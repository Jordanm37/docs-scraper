# [​](#broadcast-groups) Broadcast Groups

**Status:** Experimental  
**Version:** Added in 2026.1.9

## [​](#overview) Overview

Broadcast Groups enable multiple agents to process and respond to the same message simultaneously. This allows you to create specialized agent teams that work together in a single WhatsApp group or DM — all using one phone number.
Current scope: **WhatsApp only** (web channel).
Broadcast groups are evaluated after channel allowlists and group activation rules. In WhatsApp groups, this means broadcasts happen when Clawdbot would normally reply (for example: on mention, depending on your group settings).

## [​](#use-cases) Use Cases

### [​](#1-specialized-agent-teams) 1. Specialized Agent Teams

Deploy multiple agents with atomic, focused responsibilities:

Copy

```
Group: "Development Team"
Agents:
  - CodeReviewer (reviews code snippets)
  - DocumentationBot (generates docs)
  - SecurityAuditor (checks for vulnerabilities)
  - TestGenerator (suggests test cases)
```

Each agent processes the same message and provides its specialized perspective.

### [​](#2-multi-language-support) 2. Multi-Language Support

Copy

```
Group: "International Support"
Agents:
  - Agent_EN (responds in English)
  - Agent_DE (responds in German)
  - Agent_ES (responds in Spanish)
```

### [​](#3-quality-assurance-workflows) 3. Quality Assurance Workflows

Copy

```
Group: "Customer Support"
Agents:
  - SupportAgent (provides answer)
  - QAAgent (reviews quality, only responds if issues found)
```

### [​](#4-task-automation) 4. Task Automation

Copy

```
Group: "Project Management"
Agents:
  - TaskTracker (updates task database)
  - TimeLogger (logs time spent)
  - ReportGenerator (creates summaries)
```

## [​](#configuration) Configuration

### [​](#basic-setup) Basic Setup

Add a top-level `broadcast` section (next to `bindings`). Keys are WhatsApp peer ids:

* group chats: group JID (e.g. `[email protected]`)
* DMs: E.164 phone number (e.g. `+15551234567`)

Copy

```
{
  "broadcast": {
    "[email protected]": ["alfred", "baerbel", "assistant3"]
  }
}
```

**Result:** When Clawdbot would reply in this chat, it will run all three agents.

### [​](#processing-strategy) Processing Strategy

Control how agents process messages:

#### [​](#parallel-default) Parallel (Default)

All agents process simultaneously:

Copy

```
{
  "broadcast": {
    "strategy": "parallel",
    "[email protected]": ["alfred", "baerbel"]
  }
}
```

#### [​](#sequential) Sequential

Agents process in order (one waits for previous to finish):

Copy

```
{
  "broadcast": {
    "strategy": "sequential",
    "[email protected]": ["alfred", "baerbel"]
  }
}
```

### [​](#complete-example) Complete Example

Copy

```
{
  "agents": {
    "list": [
      {
        "id": "code-reviewer",
        "name": "Code Reviewer",
        "workspace": "/path/to/code-reviewer",
        "sandbox": { "mode": "all" }
      },
      {
        "id": "security-auditor",
        "name": "Security Auditor",
        "workspace": "/path/to/security-auditor",
        "sandbox": { "mode": "all" }
      },
      {
        "id": "docs-generator",
        "name": "Documentation Generator",
        "workspace": "/path/to/docs-generator",
        "sandbox": { "mode": "all" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "broadcast": {
    "strategy": "parallel",
    "[email protected]": ["code-reviewer", "security-auditor", "docs-generator"],
    "[email protected]": ["support-en", "support-de"],
    "+15555550123": ["assistant", "logger"]
  }
}
```

## [​](#how-it-works) How It Works

### [​](#message-flow) Message Flow

1. **Incoming message** arrives in a WhatsApp group
2. **Broadcast check**: System checks if peer ID is in `broadcast`
3. **If in broadcast list**:
   * All listed agents process the message
   * Each agent has its own session key and isolated context
   * Agents process in parallel (default) or sequentially
4. **If not in broadcast list**:
   * Normal routing applies (first matching binding)

Note: broadcast groups do not bypass channel allowlists or group activation rules (mentions/commands/etc). They only change *which agents run* when a message is eligible for processing.

### [​](#session-isolation) Session Isolation

Each agent in a broadcast group maintains completely separate:

* **Session keys** (`agent:alfred:whatsapp:group:120363...` vs `agent:baerbel:whatsapp:group:120363...`)
* **Conversation history** (agent doesn’t see other agents’ messages)
* **Workspace** (separate sandboxes if configured)
* **Tool access** (different allow/deny lists)
* **Memory/context** (separate IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, etc.)
* **Group context buffer** (recent group messages used for context) is shared per peer, so all broadcast agents see the same context when triggered

This allows each agent to have:

* Different personalities
* Different tool access (e.g., read-only vs. read-write)
* Different models (e.g., opus vs. sonnet)
* Different skills installed

### [​](#example:-isolated-sessions) Example: Isolated Sessions

In group `[email protected]` with agents `["alfred", "baerbel"]`:
**Alfred’s context:**

Copy

```
Session: agent:alfred:whatsapp:group:[email protected]
History: [user message, alfred's previous responses]
Workspace: /Users/pascal/clawd-alfred/
Tools: read, write, exec
```

**Bärbel’s context:**

Copy

```
Session: agent:baerbel:whatsapp:group:[email protected]  
History: [user message, baerbel's previous responses]
Workspace: /Users/pascal/clawd-baerbel/
Tools: read only
```

## [​](#best-practices) Best Practices

### [​](#1-keep-agents-focused) 1. Keep Agents Focused

Design each agent with a single, clear responsibility:

Copy

```
{
  "broadcast": {
    "DEV_GROUP": ["formatter", "linter", "tester"]
  }
}
```

✅ **Good:** Each agent has one job  
❌ **Bad:** One generic “dev-helper” agent

### [​](#2-use-descriptive-names) 2. Use Descriptive Names

Make it clear what each agent does:

Copy

```
{
  "agents": {
    "security-scanner": { "name": "Security Scanner" },
    "code-formatter": { "name": "Code Formatter" },
    "test-generator": { "name": "Test Generator" }
  }
}
```

### [​](#3-configure-different-tool-access) 3. Configure Different Tool Access

Give agents only the tools they need:

Copy

```
{
  "agents": {
    "reviewer": {
      "tools": { "allow": ["read", "exec"] }  // Read-only
    },
    "fixer": {
      "tools": { "allow": ["read", "write", "edit", "exec"] }  // Read-write
    }
  }
}
```

### [​](#4-monitor-performance) 4. Monitor Performance

With many agents, consider:

* Using `"strategy": "parallel"` (default) for speed
* Limiting broadcast groups to 5-10 agents
* Using faster models for simpler agents

### [​](#5-handle-failures-gracefully) 5. Handle Failures Gracefully

Agents fail independently. One agent’s error doesn’t block others:

Copy

```
Message → [Agent A ✓, Agent B ✗ error, Agent C ✓]
Result: Agent A and C respond, Agent B logs error
```

## [​](#compatibility) Compatibility

### [​](#providers) Providers

Broadcast groups currently work with:

* ✅ WhatsApp (implemented)
* 🚧 Telegram (planned)
* 🚧 Discord (planned)
* 🚧 Slack (planned)

### [​](#routing) Routing

Broadcast groups work alongside existing routing:

Copy

```
{
  "bindings": [
    { "match": { "channel": "whatsapp", "peer": { "kind": "group", "id": "GROUP_A" } }, "agentId": "alfred" }
  ],
  "broadcast": {
    "GROUP_B": ["agent1", "agent2"]
  }
}
```

* `GROUP_A`: Only alfred responds (normal routing)
* `GROUP_B`: agent1 AND agent2 respond (broadcast)

**Precedence:** `broadcast` takes priority over `bindings`.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#agents-not-responding) Agents Not Responding

**Check:**

1. Agent IDs exist in `agents.list`
2. Peer ID format is correct (e.g., `[email protected]`)
3. Agents are not in deny lists

**Debug:**

Copy

```
tail -f ~/.clawdbot/logs/gateway.log | grep broadcast
```

### [​](#only-one-agent-responding) Only One Agent Responding

**Cause:** Peer ID might be in `bindings` but not `broadcast`.
**Fix:** Add to broadcast config or remove from bindings.

### [​](#performance-issues) Performance Issues

**If slow with many agents:**

* Reduce number of agents per group
* Use lighter models (sonnet instead of opus)
* Check sandbox startup time

## [​](#examples) Examples

### [​](#example-1:-code-review-team) Example 1: Code Review Team

Copy

```
{
  "broadcast": {
    "strategy": "parallel",
    "[email protected]": [
      "code-formatter",
      "security-scanner",
      "test-coverage",
      "docs-checker"
    ]
  },
  "agents": {
    "list": [
      { "id": "code-formatter", "workspace": "~/agents/formatter", "tools": { "allow": ["read", "write"] } },
      { "id": "security-scanner", "workspace": "~/agents/security", "tools": { "allow": ["read", "exec"] } },
      { "id": "test-coverage", "workspace": "~/agents/testing", "tools": { "allow": ["read", "exec"] } },
      { "id": "docs-checker", "workspace": "~/agents/docs", "tools": { "allow": ["read"] } }
    ]
  }
}
```

**User sends:** Code snippet  
**Responses:**

* code-formatter: “Fixed indentation and added type hints”
* security-scanner: “⚠️ SQL injection vulnerability in line 12”
* test-coverage: “Coverage is 45%, missing tests for error cases”
* docs-checker: “Missing docstring for function `process_data`”

## [​](#api-reference) API Reference

### [​](#config-schema) Config Schema

Copy

```
interface ClawdbotConfig {
  broadcast?: {
    strategy?: "parallel" | "sequential";
    [peerId: string]: string[];
  };
}
```

### [​](#fields) Fields

* `strategy` (optional): How to process agents
  + `"parallel"` (default): All agents process simultaneously
  + `"sequential"`: Agents process in array order
* `[peerId]`: WhatsApp group JID, E.164 number, or other peer ID
  + Value: Array of agent IDs that should process messages

## [​](#limitations) Limitations

1. **Max agents:** No hard limit, but 10+ agents may be slow
2. **Shared context:** Agents don’t see each other’s responses (by design)
3. **Message ordering:** Parallel responses may arrive in any order
4. **Rate limits:** All agents count toward WhatsApp rate limits

## [​](#future-enhancements) Future Enhancements

Planned features:

* Shared context mode (agents see each other’s responses)
* Agent coordination (agents can signal each other)
* Dynamic agent selection (choose agents based on message content)
* Agent priorities (some agents respond before others)
