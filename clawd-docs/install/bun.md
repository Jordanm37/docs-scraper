# [​](#bun-experimental) Bun (experimental)

Goal: run this repo with **Bun** (optional, not recommended for WhatsApp/Telegram)
without diverging from pnpm workflows.
⚠️ **Not recommended for Gateway runtime** (WhatsApp/Telegram bugs). Use Node for production.

## [​](#status) Status

* Bun is an optional local runtime for running TypeScript directly (`bun run …`, `bun --watch …`).
* `pnpm` is the default for builds and remains fully supported (and used by some docs tooling).
* Bun cannot use `pnpm-lock.yaml` and will ignore it.

## [​](#install) Install

Default:

Copy

```
bun install
```

Note: `bun.lock`/`bun.lockb` are gitignored, so there’s no repo churn either way. If you want *no lockfile writes*:

Copy

```
bun install --no-save
```

## [​](#build-/-test-bun) Build / Test (Bun)

Copy

```
bun run build
bun run vitest run
```

## [​](#bun-lifecycle-scripts-blocked-by-default) Bun lifecycle scripts (blocked by default)

Bun may block dependency lifecycle scripts unless explicitly trusted (`bun pm untrusted` / `bun pm trust`).
For this repo, the commonly blocked scripts are not required:

* `@whiskeysockets/baileys` `preinstall`: checks Node major >= 20 (we run Node 22+).
* `protobufjs` `postinstall`: emits warnings about incompatible version schemes (no build artifacts).

If you hit a real runtime issue that requires these scripts, trust them explicitly:

Copy

```
bun pm trust @whiskeysockets/baileys protobufjs
```

## [​](#caveats) Caveats

* Some scripts still hardcode pnpm (e.g. `docs:build`, `ui:*`, `protocol:check`). Run those via pnpm for now.
