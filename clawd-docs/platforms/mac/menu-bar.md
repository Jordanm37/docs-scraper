# [​](#menu-bar-status-logic) Menu Bar Status Logic

## [​](#what-is-shown) What is shown

* We surface the current agent work state in the menu bar icon and in the first status row of the menu.
* Health status is hidden while work is active; it returns when all sessions are idle.
* The “Nodes” block in the menu lists **devices** only (paired nodes via `node.list`), not client/presence entries.
* A “Usage” section appears under Context when provider usage snapshots are available.

## [​](#state-model) State model

* Sessions: events arrive with `runId` (per-run) plus `sessionKey` in the payload. The “main” session is the key `main`; if absent, we fall back to the most recently updated session.
* Priority: main always wins. If main is active, its state is shown immediately. If main is idle, the most recently active non‑main session is shown. We do not flip‑flop mid‑activity; we only switch when the current session goes idle or main becomes active.
* Activity kinds:
  + `job`: high‑level command execution (`state: started|streaming|done|error`).
  + `tool`: `phase: start|result` with `toolName` and `meta/args`.

## [​](#iconstate-enum-swift) IconState enum (Swift)

* `idle`
* `workingMain(ActivityKind)`
* `workingOther(ActivityKind)`
* `overridden(ActivityKind)` (debug override)

### [​](#activitykind-→-glyph) ActivityKind → glyph

* `exec` → 💻
* `read` → 📄
* `write` → ✍️
* `edit` → 📝
* `attach` → 📎
* default → 🛠️

### [​](#visual-mapping) Visual mapping

* `idle`: normal critter.
* `workingMain`: badge with glyph, full tint, leg “working” animation.
* `workingOther`: badge with glyph, muted tint, no scurry.
* `overridden`: uses the chosen glyph/tint regardless of activity.

## [​](#status-row-text-menu) Status row text (menu)

* While work is active: `<Session role> · <activity label>`
  + Examples: `Main · exec: pnpm test`, `Other · read: apps/macos/Sources/Clawdbot/AppState.swift`.
* When idle: falls back to the health summary.

## [​](#event-ingestion) Event ingestion

* Source: control‑channel `agent` events (`ControlChannel.handleAgentEvent`).
* Parsed fields:
  + `stream: "job"` with `data.state` for start/stop.
  + `stream: "tool"` with `data.phase`, `name`, optional `meta`/`args`.
* Labels:
  + `exec`: first line of `args.command`.
  + `read`/`write`: shortened path.
  + `edit`: path plus inferred change kind from `meta`/diff counts.
  + fallback: tool name.

## [​](#debug-override) Debug override

* Settings ▸ Debug ▸ “Icon override” picker:
  + `System (auto)` (default)
  + `Working: main` (per tool kind)
  + `Working: other` (per tool kind)
  + `Idle`
* Stored via `@AppStorage("iconOverride")`; mapped to `IconState.overridden`.

## [​](#testing-checklist) Testing checklist

* Trigger main session job: verify icon switches immediately and status row shows main label.
* Trigger non‑main session job while main idle: icon/status shows non‑main; stays stable until it finishes.
* Start main while other active: icon flips to main instantly.
* Rapid tool bursts: ensure badge does not flicker (TTL grace on tool results).
* Health row reappears once all sessions idle.
