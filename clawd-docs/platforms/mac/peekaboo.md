# [​](#peekaboo-bridge-macos-ui-automation) Peekaboo Bridge (macOS UI automation)

Clawdbot can host **PeekabooBridge** as a local, permission‑aware UI automation
broker. This lets the `peekaboo` CLI drive UI automation while reusing the
macOS app’s TCC permissions.

## [​](#what-this-is-and-isn’t) What this is (and isn’t)

* **Host**: Clawdbot.app can act as a PeekabooBridge host.
* **Client**: use the `peekaboo` CLI (no separate `clawdbot ui ...` surface).
* **UI**: visual overlays stay in Peekaboo.app; Clawdbot is a thin broker host.

## [​](#enable-the-bridge) Enable the bridge

In the macOS app:

* Settings → **Enable Peekaboo Bridge**

When enabled, Clawdbot starts a local UNIX socket server. If disabled, the host
is stopped and `peekaboo` will fall back to other available hosts.

## [​](#client-discovery-order) Client discovery order

Peekaboo clients typically try hosts in this order:

1. Peekaboo.app (full UX)
2. Claude.app (if installed)
3. Clawdbot.app (thin broker)

Use `peekaboo bridge status --verbose` to see which host is active and which
socket path is in use. You can override with:

Copy

```
export PEEKABOO_BRIDGE_SOCKET=/path/to/bridge.sock
```

## [​](#security-&-permissions) Security & permissions

* The bridge validates **caller code signatures**; an allowlist of TeamIDs is
  enforced (Peekaboo host TeamID + Clawdbot app TeamID).
* Requests time out after ~10 seconds.
* If required permissions are missing, the bridge returns a clear error message
  rather than launching System Settings.

## [​](#snapshot-behavior-automation) Snapshot behavior (automation)

Snapshots are stored in memory and expire automatically after a short window.
If you need longer retention, re‑capture from the client.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

* If `peekaboo` reports “bridge client is not authorized”, ensure the client is
  properly signed or run the host with `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_SOCKET_CLIENTS=1`
  in **debug** mode only.
* If no hosts are found, open one of the host apps (Peekaboo.app or Clawdbot.app)
  and confirm permissions are granted.
