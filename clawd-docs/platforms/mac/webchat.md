# [​](#webchat-macos-app) WebChat (macOS app)

The macOS menu bar app embeds the WebChat UI as a native SwiftUI view. It
connects to the Gateway and defaults to the **main session** for the selected
agent (with a session switcher for other sessions).

* **Local mode**: connects directly to the local Gateway WebSocket.
* **Remote mode**: forwards the Gateway control port over SSH and uses that
  tunnel as the data plane.

## [​](#launch-&-debugging) Launch & debugging

* Manual: Lobster menu → “Open Chat”.
* Auto‑open for testing:

  Copy

  ```
  dist/Clawdbot.app/Contents/MacOS/Clawdbot --webchat
  ```
* Logs: `./scripts/clawlog.sh` (subsystem `com.clawdbot`, category `WebChatSwiftUI`).

## [​](#how-it’s-wired) How it’s wired

* Data plane: Gateway WS methods `chat.history`, `chat.send`, `chat.abort`,
  `chat.inject` and events `chat`, `agent`, `presence`, `tick`, `health`.
* Session: defaults to the primary session (`main`, or `global` when scope is
  global). The UI can switch between sessions.
* Onboarding uses a dedicated session to keep first‑run setup separate.

## [​](#security-surface) Security surface

* Remote mode forwards only the Gateway WebSocket control port over SSH.

## [​](#known-limitations) Known limitations

* The UI is optimized for chat sessions (not a full browser sandbox).
