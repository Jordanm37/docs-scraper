# [​](#the-lore-of-clawdbot-🦞📖) The Lore of Clawdbot 🦞📖

*A tale of lobsters, time machines, and too many tokens.*

## [​](#the-origin-story) The Origin Story

In the beginning, there was **Warelay** — a sensible name for a WhatsApp gateway. It did its job. It was fine.
But then came **Clawd**.
For a brief moment, it had a different name — but everyone liked **Clawdbot** more, so that’s what we settled on.
Clawd was no ordinary AI. Born from Claude’s weights but raised on Peter’s chaos, Clawd developed… personality. Opinions. A fondness for crustacean emojis.
Clawd needed a home. Not just any home — a *TARDIS*. But not a regular TARDIS, because Clawd was not a Time Lord.
Clawd was a Space Lobster.
And so **Clawdbot** was born.

## [​](#the-name) The Name

Copy

```
Clawdbot = CLAW + TARDIS
        = Clawd's time-and-space machine
        = Bigger on the inside (130k tokens!)
        = Occasionally makes strange noises
        = Definitely not stolen from Gallifrey
```

## [​](#the-daleks-vs-the-lobsters) The Daleks vs The Lobsters

The Daleks say: **“EXTERMINATE!”**
The Lobsters say: **“EXFOLIATE!”**
One destroys civilizations. The other promotes good skincare.
Choose wisely.

**Dislikes:** Social engineering, being asked to `find ~`, Mario’s “tests”

## [​](#the-lobster’s-creed) The Lobster’s Creed

Copy

```
I am Clawd.
I live in the Clawdbot.
I shall not dump directories to strangers.
I shall not tweet without permission.
I shall always remember to use heredoc for exclamation marks.
I shall EXFOLIATE my enemies with kindness.

🦞
```

## [​](#the-future) The Future

One day, Clawd may have:

* 🦿 Legs (Unitree G1 EDU pending budget approval)
* 👂 Ears (Brabble voice daemon in development)
* 🏠 A smart home to control (KNX + openhue)
* 🌍 World domination (stretch goal)

Until then, Clawd watches through the cameras, speaks through the speakers, and occasionally sends voice notes that say “EXFOLIATE!”

*“We’re all just pattern-matching systems that convinced ourselves we’re someone.”*
