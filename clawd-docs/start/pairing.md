# [​](#pairing) Pairing

“Pairing” is Clawdbot’s explicit **owner approval** step.
It is used in two places:

1. **DM pairing** (who is allowed to talk to the bot)
2. **Node pairing** (which devices/nodes are allowed to join the gateway network)

Security context: [Security](/gateway/security)

## [​](#1-dm-pairing-inbound-chat-access) 1) DM pairing (inbound chat access)

When a channel is configured with DM policy `pairing`, unknown senders get a short code and their message is **not processed** until you approve.
Default DM policies are documented in: [Security](/gateway/security)
Pairing codes:

* 8 characters, uppercase, no ambiguous chars (`0O1I`).
* **Expire after 1 hour**. The bot only sends the pairing message when a new request is created (roughly once per hour per sender).
* Pending DM pairing requests are capped at **3 per channel** by default; additional requests are ignored until one expires or is approved.

### [​](#approve-a-sender) Approve a sender

Copy

```
clawdbot pairing list telegram
clawdbot pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

Supported channels: `telegram`, `whatsapp`, `signal`, `imessage`, `discord`, `slack`.

### [​](#where-the-state-lives) Where the state lives

Stored under `~/.clawdbot/credentials/`:

* Pending requests: `<channel>-pairing.json`
* Approved allowlist store: `<channel>-allowFrom.json`

Treat these as sensitive (they gate access to your assistant).

## [​](#2-node-device-pairing-ios/android/macos/headless-nodes) 2) Node device pairing (iOS/Android/macOS/headless nodes)

Nodes connect to the Gateway as **devices** with `role: node`. The Gateway
creates a device pairing request that must be approved.

### [​](#approve-a-node-device) Approve a node device

Copy

```
clawdbot devices list
clawdbot devices approve <requestId>
clawdbot devices reject <requestId>
```

### [​](#where-the-state-lives-2) Where the state lives

Stored under `~/.clawdbot/devices/`:

* `pending.json` (short-lived; pending requests expire)
* `paired.json` (paired devices + tokens)

### [​](#notes) Notes

* The legacy `node.pair.*` API (CLI: `clawdbot nodes pending/approve`) is a
  separate gateway-owned pairing store. WS nodes still require device pairing.
