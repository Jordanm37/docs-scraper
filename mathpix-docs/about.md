# About Mathpix

Mathpix's mission is to accelerate the pace of technological progress. We believe in the positive potential of science, engineering, and mathematics, to improve the short amount of time each person gets to spend on planet earth.

Our company is focused on saving people time when writing math on a cell phone or computer. We provide a consumer app, [Snip](/snip), that automates the tedious aspects of typing documents containing math, and we provide [Convert API](/convert) for developers to integrate OCR capabilities into their own applications. We are equally passionate about both projects and Snip is powered by Convert API.
