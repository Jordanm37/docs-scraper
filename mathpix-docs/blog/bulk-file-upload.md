In addition to [Code OCR](/blog/image-to-code-ocr) and [improved chemical diagram recognition](/blog/improved-chem-diagram-recognition) the latest Snip web release includes many improvements for users working with Notes and PDFs.

### Support for bulk file uploads

You can now select and upload multiple PDFs, Snips, and Notes simultaneously, rather than just one at a time like in the previous version. This allows you to streamline your workflow with ease, saving you valuable time and effort every step of the way.

Bulk uploading is available for any type of file supported in Snip (.pdf, .md, .jpg, .png, and .txt). To use the new bulk upload feature, simply drag and drop multiple files into the app or click Upload to select multiple files from your device:

### Improvements to processing large PDFs or on slow connections

Previously, Snip struggled to upload large PDFs with a slow internet connection. We’ve made PDF upload more robust, with automatic upload continuation on network errors.

We also added the ability to manually continue PDF upload later if your upload was interrupted for any reason. We know that life (and internet outages) happen!

### Customizable export options

Make sure that exported Notes match your desired aesthetic by choosing the document’s font type and size before conversion. ​​In addition, we’ve added automatic language detection. Now your DOCX files open in MS Word without having those pesky red “spelling error” squiggles make your work look like a crime scene!

For a more streamlined experience, disable the configuration pop-up and set your default export preferences directly in your Account Settings.

### Other improvements and bug fixes

* Added ability to preserve or remove equation numbering in PDFs
* Improved handwritten Japanese OCR
* Fixed incorrect grouping of fractional function arguments in Asciimath outputs
* Improved memory usage on iOS
