We have added basic support for [chemical diagram OCR](/image-to-smiles) to save chemistry users from having to re-create chemicals they find in textbooks and PDFs from scratch, which can be very time consuming.

Snip will return [SMILES representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) for chemicals, which is analogous to LaTeX for mathematics, and enjoys wide support across chemistry productivity software. The SMILES string can be copied to your clipboard and then pasted into [ChemDraw](/image-to-chemdraw), Scifinder, or any other chemistry software in your workflow.

For more information about using Snip with ChemDraw for chemical diagrams, check out [this docs article](https://mathpix.com/docs/snip/snip-with-chemdraw).

You can also search PubChem using the extracted SMILES information under the **Search** tab, and find information for a compound, such as InChi, Iupac names, and synonyms.

Chemical diagram OCR features not yet supported: handwritten diagrams, reaction diagrams, stereochemistry (we ignore stereochemistry).
