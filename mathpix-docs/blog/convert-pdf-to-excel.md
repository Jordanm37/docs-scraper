Never re-type tabular data cell-by-cell again! Now you can use Snip to convert tables in PDFs or images into Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, or any other spreadsheet software.

## Using the TSV format

Snip (which can be [downloaded here](https://mathpix.com/#downloads)) now returns a **TSV** format whenever a Snip contains a table.

**TSV** stands for *Tab Separated Values*, and it is a format that can be copied to your clipboard and then pasted directly into a spreadsheet.

In order to use the TSV format, click this button:

## Compatibility

You can paste TSV into:

* Microsoft Excel
* Google Sheets
* Numbers
* any other spreadsheet software
