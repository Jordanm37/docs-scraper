# Digitize drawings of equations, text, and tables instantly with the new Snip mobile and tablet apps

Recently we added a new drawing mode to the mobile apps that allows you to easily digitize drawings made with a stylus or your finger.

You can draw equations on your Android mobile device or iPhone, but **Draw mode works especially well on Android tablets that have stylus support**.

All mobile apps conveniently sync with your desktop app or [web app](https://snip.mathpix.com) via your Mathpix account, so anything you draw can quickly be appended to a document!

See the video below for a couple quick examples of drawing equations and text on an Android tablet and syncing the resulting LaTeX instantly with desktop:

Don’t have the app yet? Get it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mathpix.snip) or [iTunes App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mathpix-snip/id1445642260) today!

## Devices we recommend for drawing

These are some mobiles/tablets with stylus support that we use Snip with (and recommend):

[Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 10.5” (w/ included stylus)](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-10-5-128gb-mountain-gray/6357007.p?skuId=6357007) - $599.99

[Galaxy Note 9 (w/ S-pen)](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/galaxy-note/galaxy-note9-128gb--t-mobile--sm-n960uzkatmb/) - $409.99

[iPad Mini (w/ Apple Pencil Support)](https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/) - $399.00 + $99.00 (Pencil)

*Note: improved iPad/iPad Pro support coming soon!*

## Drawing support in the API

If you are interested in adding drawing/digital ink capabilities to your own app, we have also just released a stroke-based API endpoint, like MyScript but at a lower cost. Similar to our image endpoints, the stroke endpoint works best on math equations, english text, and tables.

More information about the new `v3/strokes` endpoint can be found on [our API docs](https://docs.mathpix.com/#process-strokes-v3-strokes).
