Mathpix Snip is the best OCR software for images and PDFs with printed or handwritten Hindi and math. It can convert files to DOCX, LaTeX, MathML, HTML, and more in a split second.

## How to convert images with Hindi characters

1. Take a screenshot of your image using keyboard shortcuts: `ctrl` + `cmd` + `M` for Mac or `ctrl` + `alt` + `M` for Windows & Linux.
2. Your image is instantly digitized and copied to your clipboard.

This even works for handwritten images with math, Hindi text, and tables!

## How to convert Hindi PDF to Word, LaTeX, and more

1. Go to [Snip web app](https://snip.mathpix.com).
2. Drag your PDF into the sidebar or directly into the document.
3. Get your [Markdown](/mathpix-markdown) result, which can be exported to DOCX, LaTeX, HTML, and Overleaf.

## How to edit converted PDFs using Snip Web

When your PDF is converted to Mathpix Markdown, you can not only manually edit it, but also insert any snip you’ve made into your note. To do so, open the “All Snips” tab, choose the snip you need, and paste it directly to your document. It’s really that easy!

Mathpix’s OCR technology can read 28 languages, including Asian, Latin, and Cyrillic alphabet languages, which makes it an indispensable OCR software. Learn about our supported languages [here](/language-support).
