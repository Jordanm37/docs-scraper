Big news! Starting March 1, 2025, we’re simplifying and lowering prices for our Image API (v3/text, v3/latex, v3/batch) to make it more affordable for all users.

### Old Pricing:

* $0.02/image (0 - 1K images)
* $0.004/image (1K - 100K images)
* $0.002/image (100K+ images)

### New Pricing (Effective March 1, 2025):

* $0.002/image (0 - 1M images)
* $0.0015/image (1M+ images)

These changes will take effect starting **March 1**, and you’ll see the new rates reflected in your **April 1** invoice.

If you process high volumes of images or have predictable usage and can commit to a set number of requests, we offer enterprise contracts with additional benefits. If you’re interested, please reach out to us via our [contact page](https://mathpix.com/contact-us).
