A recent Mathpix update brings initial support for source code recognition from images and PDFs. [Code OCR](https://snip.mathpix.com) allows you to capture and share code snippets in seconds, making it simpler to read, collaborate, and document your code in real-time.

## How to use OCR for code snippets

Just take a screenshot using the [desktop app](https://mathpix.com/desktop-downloads) and get the code copied to your clipboard automatically:

You can also upload PDFs containing any source code like research papers or notes to have them OCRed, made editable, and searchable.

## Search for code snippets in PDFs and images

Our search feature has also been optimized to recognize code snippets within academic papers, technical manuals, and other professional documents. A single keyword is all it takes to find the relevant document and navigate directly to the section where the code is located.
