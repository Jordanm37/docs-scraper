## The best OCR for chemical diagrams

Mathpix has a [chemical structure recognition tool](/image-to-smiles) which can convert images of chemical diagrams to SMILES just by taking a screenshot or photo. SMILES stands for Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System, and it allows you to represent a chemical structure in a way that can be rendered in a document. Using Snip you can easily extract chemical diagrams from a PDF or digitize your handwritten notes, and get them in SMILES format in just a few seconds!

## How to convert image to SMILES on desktop

### Step 1. Use shortcuts to take a Snip.

Press `ctrl` + `alt` + `M` for Windows & Linux or `ctrl` + `command` + `M` for Mac.

### Step 2. Crop the image you want to convert and get an instant result!

### Step 3. Paste the result into your editor

Now the SMILES string is copied to your clipboard. You can paste it into [ChemDraw](/image-to-chemdraw) or another editor with SMILES support like [Snip web app](https://snip.mathpix.com).

## Create digital chemisty on any device with Snip

You can use [Snip](/) on mobile, desktop, and the web to create beautiful, web-friendly technical documents containing math and chemistry. Our OCR features allow you to convert images of chemical diagrams to SMILES code in seconds, and our document editor powered by [Mathpix Markdown](/mathpix-markdown) allows you to easily create scientific documents and export them to formats like [DOCX](/pdf-to-word) and [LaTeX](/pdf-to-latex).
