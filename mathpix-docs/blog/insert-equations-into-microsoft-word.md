Recently we added a few new output formats to Snip in addition to LaTeX. One of those formats, [MathML](https://www.w3.org/Math/whatIsMathML.html), is especially well suited to be used with [Microsoft Word](/image-to-word).

As long as the MathML format is enabled in your app settings, each time you take a Snip of an equation you will see a **Copy MS Word** button here:

Click it to copy the MathML to your clipboard!

Here are all the steps for inserting an equation into a Word document quickly and easily using Snip:

1. Click the screenshot button or enter the shortcut `ctrl+alt+M`
2. Click and drag the box around your desired equation to Snip it
3. Copy MathML to your clipboard
4. Paste MathML into your Word document

It really is *that* simple!

# Word Tip: Formatting matrices and parentheses

Sometimes you will notice that brackets and parentheses around matrices or fractions are smaller than they should be.

In order to fix this, click the button with the ▼ on the right-hand side of the equation box. (if you don’t see this button, click on the equation and it should appear).

Click the **Professional** option from the dropdown menu. Perfect!
