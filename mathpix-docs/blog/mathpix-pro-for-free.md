We have decided to provide users on the Free plan with an additional way to get Mathpix Pro: submit an article to the [Spectra](https://spectra.mathpix.com) STEM writing competition.

Effective immediately, all authors of [eligible submissions](https://spectra.mathpix.com/guidelines) to the Spectra competition will receive six months of Mathpix Pro (per first submission, 3 months of Pro for each additional submission). Although there are only 3 cash prize winners, there is no cap on the number of submissions eligible for the Mathpix Pro prize. These awards will be in addition to the cash prizes for the first, second, and third place winners.

To receive Mathpix Pro, simply write an email to [support@mathpix.com](mailto:support@mathpix.com) using the same email address as your Snip account, tell us a little bit about who you are and what you’re passionate about, and provide a link to your public Spectra submission, and we will apply Pro to your account immediately.

## Competition deadline extended to May 1, 2022

We have extended the deadline of the current competition to May 1, 2022. You can see more details about the STEM writing competition [here](/blog/second-spectra-competition).
