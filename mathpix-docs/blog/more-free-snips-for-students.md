*This post was updated on 4/4/2022 with new information about how students can get more free usage from Mathpix and on 19/4/2023 with new usage limits for educational plan and information about institutional licences.*

In light of recent events, We have now increased the number of free Snips on the [Mathpix Free plan for educational users](/docs/snip/educational-plan) to 20.

This change applies to all current users and any future accounts created with an educational email address domain. When you sign up with your educational email, you will automatically be put on the Educational plan. If your account does not get updated automatically, you may have a domain that is not recognized by our system, just send us an email to let us know and we will fix it for you.
