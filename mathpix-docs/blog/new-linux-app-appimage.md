We have recently migrated our Linux app from Snap, an Ubuntu oriented app distribution platform, to using AppImage, which provides a self contained executable file that works similarly to Windows `.exe` files.

Many users who had issues installing and running Mathpix Snip via Snapcraft have reported that the new AppImage app we sent them in response to their support requests worked flawlessly.

The new AppImage app can be found on our website [here](https://mathpix.com). You can also download the app by [clicking here](https://download.mathpix.com/linux/Mathpix_Snipping_Tool-x86_64.latest.AppImage).

Please note that this new app will auto-update, so if we sent you a link to this app in response to a support request, you should download the app again.
