We have added a new **Search** tab to all of our apps that allows you to search with a math equation and find related content on the internet (either with the exact same equation or a related equation). You can go from picture to web search results in seconds!

This feature is especially convenient for research, diving deeper into a topic you are studying, or finding resources when you are stuck on a particularly tricky problem.

**Search** currently supports the following websites:

* Wikipedia
* Math Stack Exchange
* MathOverflow
* Wolfram MathWorld
* Google Socratic
* PlanetMath
* NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions

Here is an example of the **Search** feature in action on mobile:

More websites coming soon…

* Arxiv
* PhysicsForums
* nLab

…and more!
