We’ve just added a new **Solver** tab in the latest version of desktop Snip, that can calculate information for some equations. We added these features to provide advanced-level math Snip users with more information about the equations they are digitizing.

# Features

The **Solver** works especially well for:

* Calculating arithmetic
* Solving and graphing algebraic equations, systems of equations, and inequalities
* Computing integrals
* Performing matrix operations (will return eigenvector, eigenvalues, and more)

Here are some examples of what the **Solver** can do:

### Example 1: Graph system of equations

Snip systems of equations, get the solution and a graph:

### Example 2: Compute integrals

Snip an integral and get the result:

### Example 3: Matrix multiplication

Snip a matrix multiplication problem, get the solution, inverse, determinant, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, characteristic polynomial, dimensions, and multiplicities:

# Sharing Solver information

The results of the **Solver** can easily be shared and pasted into any editor that supports [Mathpix Markdown](/docs/mathpix-markdown), like [Snip Web](https://snip.mathpix.com). Just click the copy button on the **Solver** tab to copy the results to your clipboard.

Here is what a result looks like when pasted into a Markdown document for this equation:

y

y

x

y

x

y
=
cos
⁡
x
{:[y=sin x],[y=cos x]:}\begin{array}{l}
y=\sin x \\
y=\cos x
\end{array}y=sin⁡xy=cos⁡x

**Solver** result:

```
### Solution
\[\left\{ \begin{array} {l} \,x = \frac{\pi}{4}\,,\quad y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\,
x = \frac{5 \pi}{4}\,,\quad y = - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{array} \right.\]
