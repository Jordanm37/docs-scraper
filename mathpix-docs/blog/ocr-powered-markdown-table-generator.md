Mathpix has a [Markdown Table Generator](/table-to-markdown) that allows you to extract tables from PDFs just by taking a screenshot!

Mathpix image-to-table conversion is compatible with your favorite editing environments that support Markdown. It’s super convenient for using with editors like [Snip](https://snip.mathpix.com), [Typora](/docs/snip/snip-with-typora), and [Notion](/docs/snip/snip-with-notion).

## How to generate Markdown tables:

1. Enter the keyboard shortcut **CTRL + ⌘ + M** (Mac) or **CTRL + ALT + M** (Windows), then click and drag the crop box around the desired table.
2. Check your Snip result and click on **Markdown tables** result.
3. Paste the Markdown table that’s been copied to your clipboard into your editor (we used Typora in this example).

Mathpix is the most powerful OCR-powered file conversion software available, especially for STEM content like math notes, problem sets, research articles, and more. In addition to the Markdown table generator, Mathpix also has a LaTeX table generator and can [convert tables in PDFs to CSV files](https://mathpix.com/blog/pdf-to-csv)!
