## PDF Conversion in Snipping Tool Desktop Apps (MacOS, Windows, and Linux)

PDF conversion is now available in all Snip desktop apps! Just like in [Snip Web](https://snip.mathpix.com/), it’s possible to upload multiple files and choose from a variety of formats to convert them into (DOCX, LaTeX, HTML, Markdown, and Mathpix Markdown).

Previously, PDF conversion was only available in our web app or using our API, but now you can conveniently convert PDFs to DOCX and other formats directly from your desktop. New “Open in Snip Web” buttons also create a seamless experience when using the Snipping Tool together with Snip Web.

### How to use PDF Conversion in the Snipping Tool:

1. Open the desktop app and navigate to the new **Convert PDF** tab.
2. **Upload** your PDFs by dragging and dropping them or using the upload button.
3. **Select the format** you wish to convert your PDFs to.
4. Click **Convert & Download** to export your converted files as a zip file directly to your device.

Click the **Open in Snip Web** icon to the right of each PDF name to open it directly in our web app, where you can view, read, edit, and search through your documents.
