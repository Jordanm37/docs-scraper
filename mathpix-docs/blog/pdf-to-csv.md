## How? PDF --> TSV --> CSV

We’ve shared a lot about how easy it is to use Snip to convert tables in PDFs into TSV format, but we know that many users require a CSV format for whatever project they are working on.

So we wanted to create a short tutorial showing how it’s just as easy it is to [convert tables in PDFs](/table-to-csv) into `.csv` files–you can do it in under 30 seconds! It’s a huge productivity boost.

Here’s a short video showing you how:

## Steps:

1. Display the table that you want to convert on your computer screen.
2. Click the screenshot button on the app or enter the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+m`/`ctrl+command+m`
3. Click and drag the crop box around the desired table.
4. Check your Snip result, then click the **Copy TSV** button.
5. Open up any spreadsheet software (we used Google Sheets in this example).
6. Paste the TSV that’s been copied to your clipboard into your spreadsheet.
7. Export the spreadsheet as a CSV file. You’re done!
