Mathpix Snip now supports document editing, document search, document exporting, PDF creation, and PDF search on mobile devices. This makes Snip into a full-featured digital notebook for researchers and STEM professionals. We have also added support for new Snip export formats previously only supported in the desktop apps.

# Convert your handwriting to editable & searchable Markdown documents

The app provides a keyboard extension in Notes mode that can be used to insert a handwritten equation captured by your camera, right into your document:

Your Markdown documents can be exported to DOCX, PDF, LaTeX, and Overleaf, right on your device:

You can also share your Notes via a public URL (but collaborative editing between multiple users is not yet supported).

Your documents sync instantly with the web app at [snip.mathpix.com](https://snip.mathpix.com) (don’t worry, we used a very simple and safe last-write-wins document syncing algorithm!) so that you can add equations, drawings, and images from your phone or tablet, and continue to edit on your desktop or laptop via the [web app](https://snip.mathpix.com).

The editing experience on our web app has also been greatly improved, and now supports a full-featured Notes search that works for text and LaTeX:

# Create PDFs from camera scans

By navigating to the PDF tab and clicking the camera button, you can create handwritten PDFs by scanning your notebook. Image filters are provided to improve PDF contrast (only available on iOS and iPad at this time).

Your PDFs can then be downloaded, exported, and searched on any device, including the [Snip web app](https://snip.mathpix.com). It’s incredibly convenient for submitting homework sets or simply preserving handwritten notes!

Here’s our PDF viewer in action, which even supports an HTML mode that can be used to make two-column PDFs readable on mobile:

# New digital ink inputs

We now support drawing with digital ink and live updates to convert math equations. Scratch over a symbol to delete it.

You can also insert a simple drawing (like a diagram) right into your document without any recognition using the “Draw image” mode:

# New output formats

You can now export Snips on mobile and tablet to the following formats:

* MathML
* Asciimath
* TSV and Markdown (tables)
