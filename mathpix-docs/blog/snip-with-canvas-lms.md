## Why using Mathpix Snip with Canvas LMS?

Canvas LMS provides a collaborative environment where educators can create and deliver course materials, including assignments and assessments. [Mathpix Snip](/snip) integrates with Canvas, allowing you to insert complex math equations directly into assignments, quizzes, and more without having to type any math. Snip’s [image conversion](/image-conversion) features significantly reduce the time and effort usually required to create and share STEM content on Canvas.

## Handwritten math made easy

Many teachers prefer to write math equations by hand during lectures or while providing personalized feedback on student submissions. Snip can [digitize your handwriting](/handwriting-recognition) and make it possible to take a photo of your notebook to transform it into LaTeX code. That’s why even handwritten content can be quickly converted and accurately displayed in Canvas.

# How to insert math from PDFs into Canvas:

1. Use our [desktop tool](/snipping-tool) to take a screenshot of the math you wish to insert into your quiz question. Make sure to copy the raw LaTeX format (first row on the OCR tab):

2. On the Canvas editor menu click **More**, then click the equation button and paste the raw LaTeX into the text box. Click **Done**:

3. Follow the same steps as above to finish your question and insert math into the answer field:
