# Mathpix now supports basic table recognition

We are very excited to announce that we have just released basic table recognition in our apps and API!

You can now generate `tabular` data instantly from a screenshot that can easily be pasted into any LaTeX editor like [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), or the [Snip Editor](https://snip.mathpix.com) (our [Mathpix Markdown](https://github.com/Mathpix/mathpix-markdown-it) editor that supports the `tabular` LaTeX environment).

## Digitize screenshots of tables with Snip

Check out this video to see some examples of what we can digitize:

[Download Snip](https://mathpix.com/#downloads) and try for yourself!

## Digitize images of tables with the API

If you want to digitize tables using the Convert API, be sure to use the `v3/text` endpoint.

[Learn more about the Convert API v3/text endpoint](https://docs.mathpix.com/#process-image-v3-text)

## Coming soon…

* Improved accuracy on more complicated tables
* Recognition for tables containing `\multirow` and `\multicolumn`
* Alternative formats for tables, like HTML and TSV
* Speed improvements
