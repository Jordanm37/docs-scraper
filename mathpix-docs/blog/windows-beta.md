We just released the beta of our Windows Snipping Tool on our website. We are so excited to finally offer a solution for our Windows users to take a screenshot of any math on their desktop and instantly have the LaTeX copied to their clipboard. #MicrosoftAI

Start saving time in minutes by downloading and installing the app from our landing page! The app works just like our MacOS app. All you have to do is hit the Mathpix shortcut, `CTRL + ALT + M`, and click and drag to capture a snip of your screen. The LaTeX renders instantly, and the code is copied to your clipboard. All that’s left for you to do is paste.

More features are in the works, and we can’t wait to share them with you!
