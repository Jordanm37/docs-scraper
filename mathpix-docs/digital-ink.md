## Digital ink API features

* ### Live updates

  Our digital ink API endpoint allows you to display live rendering updates to your end user as they draw. The immediate feedback provides a great user experience that allows users to check their work as they go. Note that live updates are an optional feature and the [v3/strokes](https://docs.mathpix.com/#process-stroke-data) endpoint can be called without.

* ### Scribble to erase

  Our live drawing supports common user actions like scribbling something out to erase it. Provide an elevated user experience with easy mistake correcting.

* ### Strikethrough to erase

  Strikethrough is another common user action your end-user can use to make quick and easy changes to what they have drawn and correct mistakes if necessary.

## Digital ink + image OCR = a complete solution

Where some providers only offer digital ink or image processing, Mathpix provides the only complete analog to digital API solution with our dual offering of digital ink stroke recognition with lives updates and image or PDF optical character recognition APIs.
