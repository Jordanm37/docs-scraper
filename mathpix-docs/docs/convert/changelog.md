# December 24, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-109p6 (`v3/pdf`)
* Conversions improvements:
  + Improved LaTeX list conversion across all export formats, with better support for deeply nested lists and lists inside tables.
  + Added support for custom list markers (e.g., `\item[□]`) in Markdown and PPTX exports, and improved marker styling in DOCX.
  + Refined HTML rendering for items without visible markers (`\item[]`) to avoid excessive indentation.
  + Enhanced LaTeX export for special symbols and deeper list nesting when needed.

# December 17, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-109p5 (`v3/pdf`)
* Conversions improvements:
  + Code listings (`lstlisting`). Added full support for LaTeX `lstlisting` code blocks across all export formats.
  + LaTeX
    - Code listings now support Unicode characters, including Cyrillic, Greek, and mathematical symbols.
    - Line breaks and alignment are preserved correctly.
    - Mathematical expressions inside code blocks are rendered when the `mathescape` option is enabled.
  + DOCX
    - Code listings are exported consistently with Markdown code blocks.
    - Mathematical expressions are rendered when `mathescape` is enabled.
    - Supported inside tables.
  + PPTX
    - Code listings are exported consistently with Markdown code blocks.
    - Mathematical expressions are rendered when `mathescape` is enabled.
    - Supported inside tables.
  + XLSX
    - Added support for code listings inside tables.
    - Mathematical expressions are exported in inline (linear) form when `mathescape` is enabled.
  + Markdown
    - Code listings outside tables are exported as standard Markdown code blocks.
    - Code listings inside tables are exported as `<pre><code>` blocks:
    - Line breaks are preserved
    - HTML content is safely escaped

# December 10, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-109p4
* Improved usage consistency of `\begin{figure}...\end{figure}` in the output

For `v3/pdf` requests with options set `"include_chemistry_as_image": true` and `"include_smiles": true` we used to return Markdown style image links and associated figure labels like this:

```
![<smiles>C=O</smiles>]($IMAGE_URL)
Formaldehyde
```

We have corrected that to be more consistent with other image links, and we now return:

```
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[alt={<smiles>C=O</smiles>},max width=\textwidth]{$IMAGE_URL}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Formaldehyde}
\end{figure}
```

# December 10, 2024

* Deployed new version SuperNet-109p3 (`v3/pdf`)
* Conversions improvements:
  + LaTeX
    - Added support for image alt text via `\includegraphics[alt={...}]`.
    - Added support for the max width option in `\includegraphics` to prevent unnecessary image scaling.
  + HTML / PDF
    - Added support for max width in `\includegraphics` for more accurate image sizing.
    - Added support for preserving and exporting alt text from `\includegraphics`.
  + DOCX
    - Added support for image alternative text when provided in the source MMD.
  + Markdown
    - Added support for exporting alt text from `\includegraphics` into Markdown image syntax.

# November 27, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-109p2
* Fixing a few rare cases of internal errors

# November 26, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-109p1
* Minor bug fixes

# November 24, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-109
* Image/PDF segmentation improvements

# November 17, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-108
* OCR improvements and initial recognition support for new languages:
  + Greek language
  + modern Georgian scripts (Mkhedruli and Mtavruli)
* Using Unicode symbols instead of inline Latex for form fields:
  + `□` in cases where `$\square$` was used
  + `◯` in cases where `$\bigcirc$` was used

# November 7, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-107p3 (`v3/pdf`)
* Added XLSX (Excel) export support:
  + Introduced full conversion from Markdown and LaTeX tables to native Excel spreadsheets.
  + Each extracted table is rendered as an individual worksheet, or — optionally — all tables can be merged into a single sheet (`singleSheet` option).
  + Text, math, and images are preserved within table cells. Math content can be output in `linearmath`, `latex`, or `asciimath` format (`mathOutputFormat`).
  + Supports borders (`solid`, `double`, `dashed`, or none), merged cells (`multirow` / `multicolumn`), and precise handling of nested tables.
  + Column widths and row heights are automatically adjusted to fit content; maximum width is capped by `maxColumnWidthChars` (default: `255`).
  + Font size and scaling are configurable (`fontSize`, `zoomScale`), ensuring consistent appearance in Excel and Numbers.

# October 16, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-107p2 (`v3/text`)
* Fixing rare problems with requests processed with `"enable_blue_hsv_filter": true`

# October 15, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-107p2 (`v3/pdf`)
* Fixing image links escaping inside tables in cases where it wasn’t done properly

# October 14, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-107p1
* Post-processing speed improvements

# October 8, 2025

* DOCX conversion improvements:
  + Added bookmarks for all headings.
    - Bookmarks are invisible anchors in DOCX that let internal links jump to specific headings and make the Navigation pane work reliably.
    - Improves in-document navigation, stabilizes cross-references, and helps accessibility tools.
    - Deterministic, Unicode-safe names (NFC): spaces → `_`, disallowed characters → `_`; capped at 40 code points with a short hash suffix when truncated. Non-Latin scripts are supported. Internal links like `[#section-…]` now target these bookmarks automatically.
    - No visible text changes; documents open with reliable navigation and links out of the box.
    - **Example:** `[See Section 4](#section-4-system-information)` now jumps to the heading “Section 4 — System Information”.

# October 6, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-107
* OCR quality improvements, chemistry recognition improvements

# September 23, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-106p1
* Post-processing improvements for nested tables, and multi-column text; output changes related to form fields

Instead of `$qquad$` fill-in-the-blanks type of form fields will be recognized as `$\_\_\_\_$`. Additionally, we added  
support for radiobuttons (`$\bigcircle$`), and checkboxes (`$\square$`).

# September 22, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-106
* OCR quality improvements; better support for mixed fractions

Mixed fractions are fractions that consist of whole number part and a proper fractions part. For a given example:

![](images/mixed_fraction_0.png)

the whole part is `5`, and a proper fraction is `\frac{3}{4}`. Our OCR API returns:

```
\( 5 \frac{3}{4} \)
```

# September 11, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p13 (`v3/pdf`)
* Conversions improvements:
  + Added SVG export support across DOCX/LaTeX/PPTX formats
* Added Q.E.D. symbol rendering as `$\square$` (given that `$` is specified inline math delimiter)

# September 8, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p12 (`v3/pdf`)
* Prevented excluding text lines from the final output in some rare cases
* Released HTML, MMD, and MD ZIP export formats

# September 3, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p11 (`v3/pdf`)
* Improved text formatting in some hard cases

# August 23, 2025

* Deployed new post-postprocessing via new minor version update SuperNet-105p10
* Improved chemistry rendering with more consistent font sizes for atom labels

  `<metadata>`

# August 20, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p9 (`v3/pdf`)
* Conversions improvements:
  + DOCX/HTML: Improved conversion of images in `\includegraphics` for which ``\textwidth` is set.

# August 13, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p8
* Improving MMD formatting, “merging” adjacent inline math, better ordering for multiple choice questions (`v3/pdf`)

# August 12, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p7
* Fixes for some very rare Latex post-processing errors

# August 11, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p6
* Added new API option `"include_page_info": boolean` to both `v3/text` (default `true`) and `v3/pdf` (default `false`) endpoints

Page info refers to various elements that are not part of the main text, for example consider this partial crop of the famous *Attention is all you need* paper:

![](images/page_info_0.png)

The text in red at the top of the page, and the rotated side text, both classify as page info.

In `v3/text` we’ve always returned such text as a part of final MMD (`"text"` field in the result), but in `v3/pdf` it was only  
accessible through `lines.json` output format. Now, whether it is part of the final MMD or not, is controlled with this new option `"include_page_info": boolean`.

# August 8, 2025

# August 4, 2025

* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p2
* Minor fix
* Deployed new version SuperNet-105p1
* Minor fixes
* Deployed new version SuperNet-105
* Adding detection of figure labels, and adding support for associating figure labels with diagrams, charts, and tables

Text that describes a diagram, or a table is now detected as a new `figure_label` type. In `lines.json` (`v3/pdf`), and  
`line_data` (`v3/text`), figure labels are associated to tables and diagrams via optional `selected_labels` field.  
Selected labels is simply a list of associated line IDs.

### Changes to the final MMD

For example, here is the relevant part of the famous *Attention is all you need* paper:

![](images/figure_label_0.png)

The final MMD will contain something like:

```
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_04_a72bae3a0cdf39de5533g-03.jpg?height=1137&width=785&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=674}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.}
\end{figure}

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.
```

which renders as:

![](images/figure_label_0_render.png)

Similarly, for a table with associated figure label, we would now return MMD similar to this:

![](images/figure_label_table_0.png)

```
\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. \(n\) is the sequence length, \(d\) is the representation dimension, \(k\) is the kernel size of convolutions and \(r\) the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Layer Type & Complexity per Layer & Sequential Operations & Maximum Path Length \\
\hline Self-Attention & \(O\left(n^{2} \cdot d\right)\) & \(O(1)\) & \(O(1)\) \\
\hline Recurrent & \(O\left(n \cdot d^{2}\right)\) & \(O(n)\) & \(O(n)\) \\
\hline Convolutional & \(O\left(k \cdot n \cdot d^{2}\right)\) & \(O(1)\) & \(O\left(\log _{k}(n)\right)\) \\
\hline Self-Attention (restricted) & \(O(r \cdot n \cdot d)\) & \(O(1)\) & \(O(n / r)\) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

which renders like this:

![](images/figure_label_table_0.png)

Please note that plain MD export does not change, MD for a previous table looks like this:

```
Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. $n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the representation dimension, $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions and $r$ the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.
| Layer Type | Complexity per Layer | Sequential Operations | Maximum Path Length |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Self-Attention | $O\left(n^{2} \cdot d\right)$ | $O(1)$ | $O(1)$ |
| Recurrent | $O\left(n \cdot d^{2}\right)$ | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ |
| Convolutional | $O\left(k \cdot n \cdot d^{2}\right)$ | $O(1)$ | $O\left(\log _{k}(n)\right)$ |
| Self-Attention (restricted) | $O(r \cdot n \cdot d)$ | $O(1)$ | $O(n / r)$ |
```

### Changes to `lines.json` output

In `lines.json` both diagram and table for the examples above, will contain a reference to the associated figure label.  
Here is how it looks for the diagram (only relevant part is shown):

* Overall image parsing improvements, and additional features:
  + we are adding `id`, `parent_id`, `children_ids`, `type`, `subtype`, `conversion_output`, and `text_display` to `lines.json` line format (`v3/pdf*`)
    - `lines.json` will now contain full hierarchy of page elements, even when there is no `text` directly associated with it (for example table of contents, text column, etc.)
    - `text` field of `lines.json` will be an empty string in cases when no search text can be associated with page element in order not to break the existing client code
    - all other fields that were added will be included only if there is a value; for example if the page element does not have any children there will be no key `children_ids` for that element in the JSON
    - `lines.mmd.json` is left unchanged in order not to break the client code, but we encourage you to switch to using richer `lines.json` format
  + we are adding `id`, `parent_id`, and `children_ids` to line data output format (`v3/text`); if there is no parent, or no children appropriate keys will be omitted from the output
  + returning in-diagram text as a part of line data (`v3/text`) and lines.json data (`v3/pdf*`)
    - needs to activated with request option `"include_diagram_text": true`
    - this feature is basic, and regular accuracy improvements are expected over the next period
    - `parent_id`/`children_ids` can be used to associate particular text with the correct diagram
  + improved code/pseudocode recognition
  + improved handling of rotated images and rotated PDF pages
  + improved recognition of +/-90 degrees rotated table cells
  + initial support for recognition of diagonally split table cells

For example, when `"include_equation_tags": true`, we will now recognize this part of the image/PDF page:

![](images/inline_math_equation_tags.png)

as (please note equation tags for each equation):

```
Finally, $\Gamma_{l}, \Delta_{q}, \Delta_{r}$ and $\Delta_{t}$ are the result of the surface integrations of the modes:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma_{l}=\iint_{S} W_{l}^{2}(x, z) d x d z \tag{36}
\end{equation*}
$$
$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_{q}=\iint_{S}\left(\Phi_{q}^{I}\right)^{2}(x, z) d x d z \tag{37}
\end{equation*}
$$
$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_{r}=\iint_{S_{w}}\left(\Phi_{r}^{I I}\right)^{2}(x, z) d x d z \tag{38}
\end{equation*}
$$
$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_{t}=\iint_{S}\left(\Phi_{t}^{I I I}\right)^{2}(x, z) d x d z \tag{39}

```
Skovhus and Thomsen (2020) have previously articulated a pertinent concern in their study on taster programmes. The concern is that:

> When students, maybe with good reason, perceive career guidance activities as intended to help them make a choice, many of those who have already decided on a particular upper secondary programme find them a waste of time ... The reason for this is that the taster programmes, with few exceptions, are detached from the curriculum of the various compulsory school subjects and, as such, not integrated in classroom teaching. The activities become isolated, one-off events with no systematic preparation beforehand or facilitated reflection afterwards. (p. 260-261)

They advocate for a fundamental shift in the orientation of taster programme activities and school-based career guidance in general. Their argument is rooted in the need to redirect the focus from mere educational choices towards a more comprehensive and holistic career learning approach that fosters young individuals' exploration of education and career possibilities. This

# November 1, 2024

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M134p2 (`v3/text`) and RSK-P124p2 (`v3/pdf*`)
* Fixes for rare bugs that occurred during table segmentation
* Better support for custom math display delimiters like `["\\begin{equation*}\n", "\n\\end{equation*}"]` with equation tags

Most common choices like `$$` and `\[, \]` work well in cases like:

```
\[
\begin{align*}
x &= y^2 \tag{1}\\
&= 16 \tag{2}
\end{align*}
\]
```

while display delimiters like `\begin{equation*}, \end{equation*}`, do not. For example, this is not rendering due to nesting of math environments:

```
\begin{equation*}
\begin{align*}
x &= y^2 \tag{1}\\
&= 16 \tag{2}
\end{align*}
\end{equation*}
```

To prevent bad outcomes, we’re now keeping the original math environment when necessary, in order to support equation tags properly. We omit `equation*` environment and produce the following output:

```
\begin{align*}
x &= y^2 \tag{1}\\
&= 16 \tag{2}
\end{align*}
```

# October 28, 2024

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M134p1 (`v3/text`) and RSK-P124p1 (`v3/pdf*`)
* Minor pre-processing changes

# October 22, 2024

* Deployed new version RSK-P124 (`v3/pdf*`)
* Added support for rotated parts of PDF page(s) (e.g. 90 degrees rotated table)

Previously, `v3/pdf` wasn’t handling PDF pages with rotated content properly, leading to parts of page being digitized as an image link instead of recognized content. This has changed with current version.

For example, a PDF page like this one:

![](images/table_rotated_0.jpg)

is now processed in `v3/pdf` into the following MMD:

```
Table 1 Common Q System Qualified Components
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

```

This deployment corrects it to:

```
\footnotetext{
* My single line footnote
}
```

In some ambiguous cases, we have been omitting the closing triple back ticks which are MMD code delimiters. That has lead to improper rendering in those cases. Most of these situations, if not all, should be fixed by this deployment.

# August 20, 2024

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M132p3 (`v3/text`) and RSK-P118p5 (`v3/pdf`)

This deployment improves on table OCR when tables have cells with complex content. Here is an example of a very simple table with a complex cell just to illustrate the type of data that these changes affect positively:

![](images/tableocr_0.png)

First cell of the second row has 3 lines of text and an equation. The table gets processed into MMD like this one:

```
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline First column & Second column & Third column \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
This cell has multiple lines \\
which enables testing tableocr properly. \\
Here goes the equation: \\
\( L=-\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_{i} \log \left(\hat{y}_{i}\right) \)
\end{tabular} & Normal cell & Normal cell \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

# June 22, 2024

* Deployed new version RSK-M131p6i2 (`v3/text`)
* Fixes internal errors in `v3/text` when invalid `format` is specified in `"formats"` request argument. Instead of internal error we now return results for all supported formats the were specified in the request, and we ignore the unsupported ones.

* Deployed new versions RSK-P116p2i1 (`v3/pdf`)
* Given `$` as inline math delimiter, form fields are recognized without surrounding spaces as `$\qquad$` instead of `$ \qquad $` because the former has rendering issues

# May 30, 2024

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M131p2i1 (`v3/text`) and RSK-P116p1i1 (`v3/pdf`)

# May 15, 2024

* Deployed new version: RSK-P115 (`v3/pdf`)
* Improved handling of large capital letters at the beginning of paragraphs (see below)

For cases like this one, where the paragraph starts with a very large letter:

![](images/big_capital_letter.jpg)

```

with a focus on starting **T** being handled properly.

# May 9, 2024

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M129p2i1 (`v3/text`) and RSK-P114p2i1 (`v3/pdf`)

  + Faster response times across all endpoints.
  + Large PDFs should now go from `loaded` to `split` much faster (splitting time).

# May 1, 2024

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M129p1 (`v3/text`) and RSK-P114p1 (`v3/pdf`)
* Post-processing updates for source code, among others:
  + `\rightarrow` to `->`
  + `\Rightarrow` to `=>`

# April 30, 2024

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M129 (`v3/text`) and RSK-P114 (`v3/pdf`)
* Update improves on handwritten Japanese and source code recognition

This update brings initial support for correct source code recognition from images. For example, for an image with source code listing like the following:  
![](images/code_sample_0.jpg)  
Mathpix now returns:

```
By combining multimethods and packages, we can simplify the abstract syntax tree example by bundling the visitation methods for each tree operation in a package.
```
object TypeChecker {
public:
    void Visit(AssignmentNode & n) {
        // ...
        Visit (n.LHS ());
        Visit (n.RHS ());
        // ...
    }
    void Visit(VariableRefNode & n);
    // ...
};
object CodeGenerator {
public:
    void Visit(AssignmentNode & n);
    void Visit(VariableRefNode & n);
    // ...
};
Node & root = // ...
TypeChecker.Visit(root);
CodeGenerator.Visit(root);
```
```

which gets renders as:  
![](images/code_sample_rendered_0.jpg)

Similarly, pseudocodes are also wrapped in three back ticks, while Latex with math notation is output. Note, this format for pseudocodes is likely to change in the future.

For pseudocode like the following image:

![](images/pseudocode_sample_0.jpg)

the output returned looks like:

```
```
Algorithm 3 An algorithm to divide a given size budget among subexpressions ${ }^{9}$
    func Divide ( $a$ : Arity, $q$ : Size, $l$ : Op. Level, $j$ : Expr. Level, $\alpha$ : Accumulated Args.)
    - Requires: $1 \leq a \leq q \wedge l \leq j$
        if $a=1$ then
            if $l=j \vee \exists\langle x, y\rangle \in \alpha: x=j$ then return $\{(1, q) \diamond \alpha, \ldots,(j, q) \diamond \alpha\}$
            return $\{(j, q) \diamond \alpha\}$
        $L=\{\}$
        for $u \leftarrow 1$ to $j$ do
            for $v \leftarrow 1$ to $(q-a+1)$ do
                $L \leftarrow L \cup \operatorname{DIVIDE}(a-1, q-v, l, j,(u, v) \diamond \alpha)$
        return $L$
```
```

If one wants to render recognized pseudocode, it is recommended to remove back ticks and replace indents of 4 spaces with `$\quad$` . After these transformations the result is:  
![](images/pseudocode_sample_rendered_0.jpg)

While Mathpix used to return links of image crop for source code and pseudocodes `v3/pdf`, that behavior is now changed and `v3/pdf` now returns MMD outputs as described in this changelog.

# April 27, 2024

* Improved export to DOCX: added flattening of nested text tables if the nested table is just one column with several rows.

# March 15, 2024

* Deployed new version: RSK-P111p5i2 (`v3/pdf*`)
* `MMD to PDF-LaTeX` conversion improvements
  + Added additional fonts to support a broader range of scripts.
  + Expanded language detection capabilities to accurately and more reliably handle texts.

    across documents.
* `MMD to LaTeX` conversions and the `tex.zip` extension’s output may now include code requiring XeLaTeX for proper rendering of non-LGC texts. It’s notable that only `Note to PDF-LaTeX` allows for specific font selection. For `MMD to LaTeX` and the output from the `tex.zip` extension, conversions standardize on CMU Serif and Noto Serif for non-LGC scripts.

# March 13, 2024

* Deployed a new version: RSK-M127p5i1 (`v3/text`).
* Fixed incorrect duplication of the “caret” in Asciimath outputs (e.g., `100(1.03)^2t=5000` instead of `100(1.03)^(^^)2t=5000`).

# February 6, 2024

* Deployed new version: RSK-P111p2 (`v3/pdf*`)
* Added new API option `"include_equation_tags": boolean`

We’re excited to announce an enhancement to our `v3/pdf*` endpoints: the ability to include recognized equation numbers directly within the MMD output. Previously, equation numbers were only accessible through the `lines.json` output format, serving primarily for search purposes without visibility in the main MMD content.

With the new `"include_equation_tags": true` parameter, our system now integrates equation numbers seamlessly into the MMD output, utilizing the `\tag` element for clear association. This improvement enriches the MMD files by directly linking equations with their corresponding numbers, facilitating easier reference and navigation.

Here is an example of how the result changes:

For this part of the PDF file

![](images/eq_number_part_of_pdf_page.png)

we currently return this MMD:

```
It is not immediately obvious from Maxwells equations that the time-varying current is the source of radiation. A simple transformation of the Maxwells equations

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} & =-\mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{H}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} & =\varepsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{J}
\end{aligned}
\]

into a single second-order equation either for \(\mathbf{E}\) or for \(\mathbf{H}\) proves this statement. By taking the curl of both sides of the first equation in (1.2) and by making use of the second equation in (1.2), we obtain

\[
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{E}+\mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial^{2} \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^{2}}=-\mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{J}}{\partial t}
\]

From (1.3), it is obvious that the time derivative of the electric current is the source for the wave-like vector \(\mathbf{E}\).
```

With the new option enabled (`"include_equation_tags": true`), we now return:

```
It is not immediately obvious from Maxwells equations that the time-varying current is the source of radiation. A simple transformation of the Maxwells equations

\[
\begin{align*}
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} & =-\mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{H}}{\partial t}  \tag{1.2a}\\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} & =\varepsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{J} \tag{1.2b}
\end{align*}
\]

into a single second-order equation either for \(\mathbf{E}\) or for \(\mathbf{H}\) proves this statement. By taking the curl of both sides of the first equation in (1.2) and by making use of the second equation in (1.2), we obtain

\[
\begin{equation*}
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{E}+\mu \varepsilon \frac{\partial^{2} \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^{2}}=-\mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{J}}{\partial t} \tag{1.3}
\end{equation*}
\]

From (1.3), it is obvious that the time derivative of the electric current is the source for the wave-like vector \(\mathbf{E}\).
```

Besides added equations numbers, there are other differences in the output:

1. Individual numbered equations are wrapped in `\begin{equation*}...\end{equation*}` to support numbering.
2. The `aligned` environment is now replaced with `align*` to support numbering
   * We also replace `gathered` with `gather*`.
   * In general, we will use the environments that support numbering when using `"include_equation_tags": true`.
3. These changes are also visible in `lines.mmd.json` format.

Here is what the rendering of the recognized portion of PDF page looks like:

![](images/eq_number_part_of_pdf_page_rendering.png)

Note that there are some limitations in the current implementation:

1. We do not generate equation references in the text (e.g. `\ref{eq:1.3}`). In the given example, in the last paragraph, the equation `(1.3)` is being referenced. While that reference is straight forward, equations `(1.2a)` and `(1.2b)` are being referenced as *the first equation in (1.2)* and *the second equation in (1.2)*. This demonstrates that it takes significant semantic understanding of the document content to correctly unravel all the references, and is beyond the scope of this update.
2. We do not generate equation labels at the moment. The reasons are:
   * We do not generate `\ref` elements in text, and that would make `\label` elements redundant
   * Some widely used LaTeX rendering libraries do not support `\label` and `\ref`
     + Katex does not support it. [Additional details](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/2003)
3. When we have a block equation for which we output an *array* environment, and this block has multiple equation numbers associated with it, only the last equation number is being tagged. This is because LaTeX allows only one equation number per *array*. The same holds for the *cases* environment. We do plan to add support for the *numcases* environment which will enable multiple tags per one block of equations.

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M127, RSK-P111 (`v3/pdf*`);
* Initial OCR support Jordan matrices, improvements for tensor indices, and handwritten content;

For example, Mathpix can now correctly recognize matrices as this one:

![](images/jordan_matrix_0.jpg)

and return the result:

```
\( \left(\begin{array}{ccc}\boxed{\begin{array}{cc}18 & -15 \\ 89 & 22\end{array}} & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & \boxed{\begin{array}{cc}-83 & -6 \\ 9 & 3\end{array}}\end{array}\right) \)
```

* OCR improvements of images with complex tensor indices;

For example, for this image:

![](images/tensor_indices_0.jpg)

the result LaTeX used to be:

```
\( \epsilon_\sigma^{\mu \nu \rho} \)
```

For the same image, the new deployment now returns:

```
\( \epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho}{ }_{\sigma} \)
```

Here is the difference in rendering previous and current results showing the improvement:

In the line data, sentence has `is_printed` true and `is_handwritten` false, while the math has `is_handwritten` true and `is_printed` false.

Sometimes, the content can be both printed and handwritten at the same time. Here is one such example:

![](/examples/printed_handwritten_1.jpg)

For the request:

```
{
  "src": "https://mathpix.com/examples/printed_handwritten_1.jpg",

It can be seen in the `line_data` that the line object has both `is_printed` and `is_handwritten` set to true.

In `v3/pdf*` endpoint(s) `lines.json` and `lines.mmd.json` outputs are updated with new `is_printed`and `is_handwritten` fields for each line.

# December 13, 2023

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M121, RSK-P106 (`v3/pdf*`);

# December 7, 2023

* Deployed new version (`v3/pdf`), `RSK-P105`;
* Another improvement for table of contents pages.

# November 28, 2023

* Deployed new version (`v3/pdf`), `RSK-P104`;
* Improved processing of table of contents pages.

# October 31, 2023

* Deployed new version (`RSK-M120`);
* Chart detection;

This is a first step towards recognition of charts. Basic charts detection is supported in images.

When `"include_line_data": true` is specified in the request, for all the charts we now return correct `chart` type in line data response instead of generic `diagram`. Currently, several types of charts are being detected:

1. column chart
2. bar chart
3. line chart
4. pie chart
5. area chart
6. scatter chart

The type of chart is available as `"subtype": ...` field of the line object. This list will be extended with additional categories in the future.

* Algorithm pseudo code recognition improvements.

We used to fail recognition for images with complex algorithm pseudocode like this one:

![](images/pseudo_code.jpg)

For such image, the returned MMD now looks like this:

```
Algorithm 1 Gradient Sign Dropout Layer (GradDrop Layer)
choose monotonic activation function \( f \quad \triangleright \) Usually just \( f(p)=p \)
choose input layer of activations \( A \quad \triangleright \) Usually the last shared layer
choose leak parameters \( \left\{\ell_{1}, \ldots, \ell_{n}\right\} \in[0,1] \quad \triangleright \) For pure GradDrop set all to 0
choose final loss functions \( L_{1}, \ldots, L_{n} \)
function \( \operatorname{BACKWARD}\left(A, L_{1}, \ldots, L_{n}\right) \quad \triangleright \) returns total gradient after GradDrop layer
for \( i \) in \( \{1, \ldots, n\} \) do
calculate \( G_{i}=\operatorname{sgn}(A) \circ \nabla_{A} L_{i} \quad \triangleright \operatorname{sgn}(\mathrm{A}) \) inspired by Equation 3
if \( G_{i} \) is batch separated then
\( G_{i} \leftarrow \sum_{\text {batchdim }} G_{i} \)
calculate \( \mathcal{P}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\frac{\sum_{i} G_{i}}{\sum_{i}\left|G_{i}\right|}\right) \quad \triangleright \mathcal{P} \) has the same shape as \( G_{1} \)
sample \( U \), a tensor with the same shape as \( \mathcal{P} \) and \( U[i, j, \ldots] \sim \operatorname{Uniform}(0,1) \)
for \( i \) in \( \{1, \ldots, n\} \) do
calculate \( \mathcal{M}_{i}=\mathcal{I}[f(\mathcal{P})>U] \circ \mathcal{I}\left[G_{i}>0\right]+\mathcal{I}[f(\mathcal{P})<U] \circ \mathcal{I}\left[G_{i}<0\right] \)
set newgrad \( =\sum_{i}\left(\ell_{i}+\left(1-\ell_{i}\right) * \mathcal{M}_{i}\right) \circ \nabla_{A} L_{i} \)
return newgrad
```

and it renders as:

![](images/pseudo_code_render.png)

While the correct indentation is still missing, the content is now being returned instead of `Content not found` error.

# October 30, 2023

* Deployed new version, RSK-P103p6 (`v3/pdf*`);
* Added support for `remove_section_numbering` and `preserve_section_numbering`. Default behavior is changed  
  to `preserve_section_numbering: True`.

\*Note that only one of `auto_number_sections`, `remove_section_numbering`, or `preserve_section_numbering` can be `true` at a time.

# October 27, 2023

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M119p7, RSK-P103p5 (`v3/pdf*`);
* Post-processing improvements: we now return result instead of `Internal error` for some classes of challenging inputs.

# October 21, 2023

* Deployed new version, RSK-P103p3 (`v3/pdf*`);
* Fixed new line inconsistencies that occurred when content from different pages is joined;
* Single new line is generated before `\footnotetext` instead of two new lines;
* Two new lines introduce a new paragraph, and that behavior was breaking rendering experience in some cases.

# October 19, 2023

* Deployed new version, `RSK-M119p6`;
* False paragraph detection fixed for images with list items that start with Cyrillic letters.

# October 18, 2023

* Deployed new version, `RSK-M119p5`;
* This update is focused towards more accurate separation of text into paragraphs.

# October 14, 2023

* Deployed new versions: RSK-M119p4, RSK-P103p2 (`v3/pdf*`);
* Fixed whitespace between Chinese symbols which used to be generated when the adjacent text lines are joined.

As an example, for image like this one:

![](images/chinese_continues_line.jpg)

the result used to look like:

`【甲】孔子说: “我十五岁开始有志于做学问，三十岁能独立做事情，四十岁能 (通达事理) 不被外物所迷惑，五十岁能知道哪 *extra whitespace* 些是不能为人力所支配的事情，六十岁能听得进不同的意见，到七十岁才做事能随心所欲，不会超过规矩。”`

Result obtained with this version does not contain extra whitespace and look like this:

`【甲】孔子说: “我十五岁开始有志于做学问，三十岁能独立做事情，四十岁能 (通达事理) 不被外物所迷惑，五十岁能知道哪些是不能为人力所支配的事情，六十岁能听得进不同的意见，到七十岁才做事能随心所欲，不会超过规矩。`

# October 13, 2023

* Deployed new version (`v3/pdf*`), `RSK-P103p1`;
* Improved ordering of answers to multiple choice questions in some cases. For this part of PDF page:

![](images/multiple_choice_example.png)

we used to return the answers in height determined order:

```
10. Demostrar que si \(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\), entonces:
a) \(|-a|=|a|\).
e) \(|a-b| \leq|a|+|b|\)
b) \(\sqrt{a^{2}}=|a|\).
f) \(||a|-| b|| \leq|a-b|\).
c) \(|a-b|=|b-a|\).
g) \(a \neq 0,\left|\frac{1}{a}\right|=\frac{1}{|a|}\).
d) \(\left|a^{2}\right|=|a|^{2}\).
h) \(b \neq 0,\left|\frac{a}{b}\right|=\frac{|a|}{|b|}\).
```

Now, we return the answers in the correct order:

```
10. Demostrar que si \(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\), entonces:
a) \(|-a|=|a|\).
b) \(\sqrt{a^{2}}=|a|\).
c) \(|a-b|=|b-a|\).
d) \(\left|a^{2}\right|=|a|^{2}\).
e) \(|a-b| \leq|a|+|b|\)
f) \(||a|-| b|| \leq|a-b|\).
g) \(a \neq 0,\left|\frac{1}{a}\right|=\frac{1}{|a|}\).
h) \(b \neq 0,\left|\frac{a}{b}\right|=\frac{|a|}{|b|}\).
```

# September 5, 2023

* Deployed new version (`v3/pdf*`), `RSK-P101`;
* Added basic support for text in the footnote section of the page. Instead of breaking the main flow, especially in multi-column documents, the text will be wrapped inside `\footnotetext{ ... }`.

* Improved quality of printed and handwritten Chinese recognition.

# April 12, 2023

As a reminder, when `"include_smiles": true` is a part of the request, Mathpix can recognize chemistry diagrams such as:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53114175/231703606-bfaed596-bd80-42b0-9e2c-8e6b19fc5166.png)

and return the SMILES representation which looks like this:

```
<smiles>Cn1c(=O)c2c(ncn2C)n(C)c1=O</smiles>
```

The list of improvements:

* support for stereochemistry:
  + for example, the image

is transcribed to: `<smiles>O=S(=O)(c1ccc(F)cc1)N1C[C@@H](O)[C@H](N2CCCC2)C1</smiles>`;

* support for Markush structures:
  + for example, the image

is transcribed to `<smiles>[Z2]Nc1c(CC([R10])CSC)ncn1CC#C</smiles>`;

* basic support for superatoms:
  + more superatoms will be supported in future;
* significant recognition accuracy improvement for both handwritten and printed chemistry diagrams.

# February 22, 2023

* Deployed new version, `RSK-111`;
* Added support for the new table recognition algorithm;
* Minor general changes needed to properly support the algorithm.

A new table recognition algorithm is available in the `v3/text` and `v3/pdf` endpoints. It can be enabled by specifying `"enable_tables_fallback": true` as one of the request arguments.

We care deeply about backwards compatibility. The new algorithm will only be used if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

* Our standard algorithm failed to recognize a table;
* `"enable_tables_fallback": true` is specified as a request argument.

We have ensured that there will be no computational overhead for customers who do not specify this option, so response times will not be affected.

We have invested in a hybrid approach that will be able to tackle complicated cases like:

* extremely large tables (e.g. tables with hundreds of cells);
* tables with very complex structures (e.g. tables with many `\multirow` and `\multicolumn` cells);
* tables featuring table cells with complex content like:
  + table cells with complex math like large matrices or several aligned equations;
  + tables cells containing whole paragraphs of text;
* tables containing text in languages that are more challenging to recognize properly compared to English:
  + this includes languages with rich alphabets like Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, and others;
* tables containing cells with rotated text;
* tables containing diagrams inside cells like:
  + table cells with chemistry diagrams (note that these can be converted to SMILES);
  + table cells with natural images or similar:
    - table will still be recognized and contain the image link for the diagram inside its cells.

We will also support all combinations of the above cases.

The algorithm we are releasing now might still struggle with:

* tables with cells containing complex math like large matrices or several aligned equations;
* tables containing diagrams inside cells;
* empty grids of cells without textual content;
* tables with rotated text are partially supported:
  + in `v3/pdf` cells containing rotated text will be embedded as images.

We will add improvements that will cover specified cases shortly.

Some differences in output produced by the new algorithm compared to the standard one:

* Column alignment is always central;
* All cells have all borders (top, bottom, right, and left).

# February 1, 2023

* Deployed new version, `RSK-110`;
* Added support for new LaTeX commands: `\measuredangle`, `\grave`, `\bumpeq`, and `\amalg`;
* Improved recognition of constructs expressed with `\lceil`, `\rceil`, `\lfloor`, and `\rfloor` in combination with `\left` and `\right`;
* Improved formatting of equations in text mode (see bellow for details);
* Improved recognition of equations that contain large sub-equations in subscripts;
* Improved recognition of handwritten French;
* Improved recognition of handwritten German;
* Improved recognition of handwritten Chinese;
* Improved recognition of handwritten Japanese;
* General improvements (new data iteration).

The default “text” output has been changed, for example see the following equation:

![](/examples/strokes_1.jpg)

from the current “text” output:

```
\( y=mx+b \)\n\( x=y^{2}-1 \)
```

and two asciimath equation outputs, to:

```
\( \begin{array}{l} y = mx + b \\ x=y^{2}-1 \end{array} \)
```

with one single asciimath equation output:

```
{:[y=mx+b],[x=y^(2)-1]:}
```

which will make the “text” derived formats more consistent with what is currently returned for equations with a left brace:

![](/examples/equation_system_0.jpg)

which currently yields this “text” output:

```
\( \left\{\begin{array}{l}2 x+8 y=21 \\ 6 x-4 y=14\end{array}\right. \)
```

and this “asciimath” output:

```
{[2x+8y=21],[6x-4y=14]:}
```

Since we are already emitting in certain cases (eg, equations with no braces aligned around the “=” sign instead of being left aligned) asciimath for `v3/text` that looks like:

```
{:[2x+8y=21],[6x-4y=14]:}
```

we consider this update to be an inconsistency bugfix instead of a new feature with the potential to break backwards compatibility.

In general, it is desirable for our API for small changes in input to result in small changes in output. For example, removing the left brace from equation 2 will simply change the `v3/text` asciimath from:

```
{[2x+8y=21],[6x-4y=14]:}
```

to:

```
{:[2x+8y=21],[6x-4y=14]:}
```

which is a smaller change than the previous behavior, in which subtracting a left brace results in two equations instead of 1.

In this version, we have changed the default Markdown / LaTeX for the following character:

```
# -> \#
```

While `#` works fine in Markdown and has the same behavior as `\#`, the former causes LaTeX compilation issues, whereas `\#` succeeds in LaTeX without any problem. We chose to always emit LaTeX `\#` instead of `#` so that our output would be more compatible and less likely to cause issues. The updated character `\#` is compatible with Markdown as well as LaTeX.

Unescaped `#` will simply no longer appear in OCR Markdown / LaTeX outputs.

Alternative math formats such as Asciimath are not affected by the change, this is a Markdown / LaTeX change only.

# October 21, 2022

* New `enable_spell_check` option to the [v3/text](https://docs.mathpix.com/#process-an-image) and [v3/pdfs](https://docs.mathpix.com/#process-a-pdf) endpoints greatly improves handwriting OCR for English (other languages coming soon).

# June 6, 2022

* Resolved a critical bug that impacted PDF processing of two-column PDFs;
* You can now request that only certain subsets of pages are processed in a PDF, via the [new page\_ranges field](https://docs.mathpix.com/#process-a-pdf);
* Pushed latency improvements that benefit all endpoints, reducing processing time by 30% on average;
* You can now query hour by hour API usage using [the following endpoint](https://docs.mathpix.com/#query-ocr-usage).

# April 27, 2022

* Updated how line data is represented for PDFs from using rectangular regions to polygonal contours (this is helpful for handwritten PDFs where text lines are generally not rectangular);
* Added page dimensions to the line-by-line data structures;
* There are two available data structures for line-by-line data:
  + [Raw PDF lines data](https://docs.mathpix.com/#pdf-lines-data): this is the ideal data structure for searching; does not contain contextual annotations for titles, abstracts, etc;
  + [Context enhanced PDF mmd lines data](https://docs.mathpix.com/#pdf-mmd-lines-data): you can use this to re-create the full document, including contextual annotations for titles, abstracts, etc. (see here for syntax);
* Published a [Github repo](https://github.com/Mathpix/live-math-drawing-demo) which contains client-side code for live  
  drawing with the Mathpix digital ink API containing a fully working example of leveraging user actions like scribbling  
  and strikethrough to delete content.

# April 18, 2022

* Added an EU server region (AWS region eu-central-1) to decrease latencies for European customer and also for adherance to GDPR:
  + Use our EU specific URL <https://eu-central-1.api.mathpix.com/> to guarantee processing in Europe;
* You can now use app-tokens for authenticating requests inside client side app code;
* The new app-tokens route provides a `include_strokes_session_id` flag, which when true, returns a `strokes_session_id` string that can be used inside calls to `v3/strokes`, enabling digital ink sessions with live updates:
  + Pricing for the strokes endpoint when using `session_id`s can be found [here](https://mathpix.com/ocr#pricing);
* Add OCR support for basic handwritten PDFs.

# March 28, 2022

* You can now get detailed line-by-line data for PDFs, including geometric coordinates, via the new `GET v3/pdf/<pdf_id>.lines.json` endpoint;
* Better robustness for our `v3/text` endpoint:
  + Our ability to correctly interpret complex layouts involving math and text has improved, with much-improved edge case handling and handling of line text for skewed images and other image distortions that occur frequently in consumer photo search applications.

# March 14, 2022

* Our new OCR models feature stringent guarantees of syntactic correctness, resolving a rare but long-standing problem of occasionally malformed LaTeX strings, resulting in rendering errors due to double subscripts, double superscripts, malformed tables, and other syntax issues. This has been fixed at a fundamental level. Syntax issues are essentially completely fixed;
* Deprecated `\atop` command in favor of `\substack`.

# February 8, 2022

We have recently switched to a new, faster database to save image and PDF data. Next week, we will decommission our old database. This will result in OCR API image results log data from before December 1st, 2021 becoming unavailable via the `GET v3/ocr-results` endpoint. Note that we have already migrated all PDF data to the new database, so there will be no data loss for PDF data.

# December 1, 2020

* Added autorotation for `v3/latex` and `v3/batch` (see <https://docs.mathpix.com/#request-parameters-3> and <https://docs.mathpix.com/#result-object-3>);
* Significant accuracy improvements to text / math localization performance for `v3/latex` and `v3/batch` for both `ocr=["math"]` (default) as well as `ocr=["math", "text"]`, resulting in lower error rates and fewer bad results.

# November 12, 2020

* Added autorotation for `v3/text`.

Images like this now work in `v3/text`:

![](/examples/algebra_rotated.jpg)

The goal of automatic rotation is to pick correct orientation for received images before any processing is done. The result of auto rotation looks like:

![](/examples/algebra.jpg)

We will soon add these features to `v3/latex` and `v3/batch` as well. We implemented a very conservative rotation confidence threshold, meaning you should still try to call the API with a properly oriented image if possible!

API docs on autorotation:

<https://docs.mathpix.com/#auto-rotation>

# November 9, 2020

* `v3/text` general improvements;

First of all, we trained our models on a larger dataset, resulting in a general accuracy increase.

Secondly, we improved the precision of predictions, at the potential cost of slightly decreasing prediction recall in some circumstances. Here is an example of an image, where previously our `v3/text` tried to read the bottom, cut off parts of the image:

![](images/detection_cleanup.png)

Now, `v3/text` ignores these sections, resulting in a much cleaner output than before. The endpoint will still try to read everything in an image (vs the `v3/latex` endpoint which tries to read the main equation), but will be slightly less aggressive in reading unusual image sections in order to avoid garbage outputs.

* Chemistry diagram detection;

We have added a new field in our LineData object, `subtype`, so that we can return more information about diagrams to API clients. Currently `subtype` can only be `chemistry`, but more diagram subtypes are coming soon.

<https://docs.mathpix.com/#linedata-object>

See an example request with chemistry: <https://mathpix.com/docs/ocr/examples#chemistry-diagrams>.

* Added ability to create and disable new API keys to [accounts.mathpix.com](http://accounts.mathpix.com) OCR dashboard;
* Added ability to invite users (to have access to API keys, usage statistics, image results dashboard) to  
  [accounts.mathpix.com](http://accounts.mathpix.com) OCR dashboard.

  + Handwriting (math and text);
  + Hindi language recognition (printed);
  + Tables and matrices;
* We now support backgroundless PNGs with alpha channels.

# August 14, 2020

* Added `include_line_data` parameter, documented in <https://docs.mathpix.com/#linedata-object;>
