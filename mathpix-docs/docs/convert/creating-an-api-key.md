# How do I get an API key?

To get an API key, first [sign up for a Mathpix account](https://accounts.mathpix.com/signup). Once you have verified your email and [logged in](https://accounts.mathpix.com/signup?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.mathpix.com), you will need to create a Convert Organization. Click on the Convert Organizations Page:

Next, choose **Create OCR API** at the top right of your screen:

You will be required to add a credit or debit card in order to activate an API key. You will also be charged a one-time, non-refundable setup fee to enable your API keys.

Once you have created your Convert organization, added your billing information, and paid your setup fee, you will see an API key on your dashboard that is ready to use. If you need additional API keys, you can create them by clicking **Create Key**:

# How do I access the results from my API keys?

You can access all the API request and reponse data from your API keys under the **Results** tab of your [Convert Organization](https://console.mathpix.com/orgs):
