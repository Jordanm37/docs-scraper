Limits control the number of images and PDFs processed in a given time period to prevent overuse. It is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of Convert API for all users.

# Rate limit

A rate limit is the maximum number of images processed by v3/text, v3/latex, or v3/batch in a given minute. This limit is set to 50 requests per minute, which can be always increased upon request.

# Page limit

A page limit is the maximum number of PDF pages that can be processed by v3/pdf within a month. This limit is set to 5,000 pages per month and can be increased upon request.

If you require higher limits to meet your needs, please feel free to contact us at [support@mathpix.com](mailto:support@mathpix.com).
