# Solving

Mathway is a popular homework help app that uses Convert API to provide step by step solutions for students stuck on homework problems:

# Image Search

Convert API powers apps like Doubtnut to create intelligent camera applications. The app queries Convert API to obtain text from user submitted images. This text is then used to search databases of curated content, allow users to find educational content they are looking for by simply taking a picture of a homework problem.

# Digitizing

Convert API powers our very own [Mathpix Snip](https://mathpix.com) app, used by top students all over the world to save time creating LaTeX documents. Mathpix Snip converts user’s screenshots to LaTeX code, which can then be pasted into any LaTeX compatible text editor.
