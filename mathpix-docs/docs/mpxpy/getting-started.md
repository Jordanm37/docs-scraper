# Getting Started with Mathpix Python SDK

This guide explains how to install the Mathpix Python SDK (mpxpy) and authenticate with Mathpix services.

## Installation

Install the SDK via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mpxpy):

```
pip install mpxpy
```

Alternatively, install it directly from GitHub for development purposes:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mathpix/mpxpy.git
cd mpxpy

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

Once installed, you can initialize the client and begin processing files.  
See the [Authentication and Environment](./authentication-and-environment) section to configure your credentials and environment.
