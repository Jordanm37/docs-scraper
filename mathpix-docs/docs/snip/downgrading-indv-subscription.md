# Downgrading your Mathpix subscription plan

You can downgrade your Mathpix subscription at any time by going to your [subscription settings](https://accounts.mathpix.com/subscription). You will see your current subscription under **My Subscriptions**.

Click the **Downgrade** button under **My Subscriptions** to downgrade to the Free plan.

To know that you have successfully downgraded your subscription, you will either see:

1. that the Free plan is now showing as **Active**, or
2. a message in red telling you when your subscription will downgrade to Free

The latter occurs if you have already paid for a month or a year, and that billing period has not yet ended. That way you get to use every day of Pro that you have already paid for.

If you change your mind, you can always click **Cancel Downgrade** before the next billing cycle to stay on the Pro plan.

Need to go back to the Pro plan later on? See our [guide to upgrading](https://mathpix.com/docs/snip/upgrading-indv-subscription) if you need help.
