# How to get the Mathpix Educational plan

If you sign up for Mathpix with your educational email, you will automatically get added to the Educational plan. This plan gives you extra usage for free.

If you have already signed up with a non-educational email, you can update your email in your [Account Settings](https://accounts.mathpix.com/account).

# Other ways to get Free usage

You can also get extra Free Snips added to your account by sharing Snip on social media, or leaving us a review in the [iTunes App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mathpix-snip/id1445642260), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mathpix.snip&hl=en_US&gl=US), or on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/mathpix/reviews).
