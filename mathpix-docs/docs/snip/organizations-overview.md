## Creating a Mathpix Organization

To create a Mathpix Organization, first [create an individual Mathpix account](/docs/snip/creating-individual-account).

Next, navigate to the [Snip Organizations tab](https://accounts.mathpix.com/organizations) of Mathpix Accounts. Click **Create organization**. Note that you will be the administrator of the organization. If you do not wish to have this role, please have the intended admin create the organization from their Mathpix account.

Next you will be prompted to enter the organization’s name and billing email. This email will receive all organizational related invoices.

![Enter your Organization name and billing email](/images/name_and_billing.webp)

Once you’ve entered the organization name and email, click **Continue to Billing**.

Now you must choose whether you would like to proceed with monthly or yearly billing plan by selecting your desired option. Next, enter the number of seats you would like to purchase for your organization. Don’t worry, you can always add more seats later if needed. Once you’ve entered the number of seats needed, you will see exactly what you will pay each month or year.

Once you’ve chosen your plan and entered your team size, click **Enter Billing Information** You should see a window appear with the option to add credit card or PayPal information.

You will know that you have entered your payment method information successfully when you see the button **Finish Creating Organization**. Once you’ve clicked that button, your organization is officially created. You will automatically be redirected to your new organizations settings.

![Organization settings is where you can update settings and add or remove members](/images/org_settings.webp)

If you select the yearly billing plan, you can choose to pay via invoice instead of via credit card. You will see this option before processing the payment for the first time. If you have chosen another payment option when creating an organization, you can always request an annual invoice later in your **Profile** settings.

![Request Annual Invoice](/images/snip-user-guide/request-annual-invoice.webp)

Once your invoice is generated, it will be sent directly to your registered email address. In this email you can find all the details about the invoice, including the invoice number and amount due.

![Invoice sent to the email](/images/snip-user-guide/invoice-mail.webp)

If you want to download your invoice, click **Download invoice** in the email or find the attached PDF file.

Go to the payment page from the previewed invoice in the email (click **Pay this invoice**) or from the downloaded file (click **Pay online**). You will be redirected to our secure payment gateway. Select your payment method and follow the instructions on the payment gateway to complete your payment transaction securely. For our Organizational subscription, we accept payments by **credit card**, **debit card**, **Google Pay**, **Link (by Stripe)**, and **bank transfer**.

## Adding or removing seats

Go to **Billing** tab and find the Subscription settings. Here you can see a number of seats you’ve purchased when creating an organization. You can always add or remove seats by clicking on the corresponding button.

![Add or remove seats](/images/add-remove-seats.webp)

If you add more seats to your organization, you will be charged at once based on the remainder of your billing term. Each new seat allows to add an extra member and raises a number of the total available usage. Note that the Organizational plan **pools everyone’s usage together**. So, if one of organization members doesn’t reach the monthly/yearly limit per seat, another member can use it.

![Add seats to organization](/images/add-seats.webp)

If you remove seats, you will receive a pro-rated credit in the next billing cycle.

![Remove seats from organization](/images/remove-seats.webp)

**Please note that removing seats will reduce a total number of available usage which can be potentially used by other organization members.**

On the **Billing** tab you can also find information about organization’s available usage.

![Available usage](/images/organization-usage.webp)

## Admin seat policy

Please note that you will be charged for an admin seat too. If you are not expecting any usage for an admin seat, you should invite a user as a **free admin**. Free admins have the same permissions regarding managing the organization as regular admins, but all the usage of free admins is counted to usage of their personal account.

![Invite a free admin](/images/invite-a-free-admin.webp)
