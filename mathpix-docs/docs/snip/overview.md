# What is Mathpix Snip?

Snip is a tool for extracting text, and particularly math, from images and documents. This text/LaTeX can then be pasted into a document editing tool such as a LaTeX or Markdown editor.

The goal of Snip is to save you time typing time-consuming LaTeX or data from tables. It can even [convert entire PDFs](/pdf-conversion) to exportable, searchable, and machine-readable text.

It is also useful for note-taking, which can be done by incorporating the mobile and desktop apps into your current workflow or by using [Snip web app](https://snip.mathpix.com), which is an online Markdown editor with extended support for LaTeX features.

# Platforms

## Desktop

[Snip on desktop](/snipping-tool) is especially convenient for extracting information from PDFs and pasting the resulting text into an editor. With a single keyboard shortcut, you can crop an equation or piece of text, and have the text/LaTeX copied to your clipboard.

Desktop apps for each platform (MacOS, Windows, and Linux) can be downloaded from [mathpix.com](https://mathpix.com/desktop-downloads).

## Mobile

[Snip on mobile](/mobile-downloads) is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mathpix-snip/id1445642260), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mathpix.snip&hl=en_US), and [Huawei](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C106969299). It allows you to take pictures with your phone of content in notebooks, textbooks, blackboards, and whiteboards that you want to digitize. You can also convert equations, tables, and chemistry by drawing them with your finger or stylus right inside the app.

The mobile app syncs images and results with your desktop apps and Snip web app.

* Collaborating on research papers

## Chrome Extension

The Mathpix Snip Chrome extension makes it possible to upload a PDF in your browser to your PDF collection in Snip instantly. We make it easy and intuitive to create a [searchable](https://mathpix.com/pdf-search), exportable collection of PDFs from [Arxiv.org](http://Arxiv.org) and other online resources. Once in Snip, you can search and read your PDFs on any device, with the ability to export your documents to DOCX, HTML, LaTeX, and Markdown. You can also extract text from your PDFs and create research summaries via our Mathpix Markdown document editor in Snip.

This Chrome extension has special features for [Arxiv.org](http://Arxiv.org), including automatic naming of your PDF files, metadata extraction, and duplication detection to prevent adding the same PDF to your collection twice.
