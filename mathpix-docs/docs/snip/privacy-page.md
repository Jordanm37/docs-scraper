# Privacy FAQ

Thank you for trusting Mathpix with your images! We take this responsibility very seriously. Below you can find easy to understand answers to common questions we get about our privacy policy and how we handle your images and data.

You can also read the full [Mathpix Privacy Policy](https://mathpix.com/privacy).

### What information does Mathpix collect from me?

Mathpix only collects and retains personal information about you:

1. When you communicate with us via email.
2. When you register for a Mathpix account (we collect your email address for account verification).
3. When upgrading from a free Snip plan (we collect your billing information securely through our payments providers).
4. When you use our Snip Apps.

The information we collect from you during app usage is always the least amount necessary to provide our service effectively:

1. The image you want to process
2. Your email
3. Your IP address
4. Your operating system information

---

### Why does Snip collect my IP address?

We collect IP addresses of Snip users to protect ourselves in the case of spamming of our servers.

---

### Why does Snip collect my operating system information?

We collect your operating system information for two purposes:

1. To fix bugs in the apps more efficiently
2. App monitoring and metrics

---

### What happens to my images when using Snip?

Your image is sent from Snip to our servers, where we process the image and return the result: either valid text/LaTeX or an image URL (in the event that we cannot extract the content of the image). This image and result will stay on our database so that you can access it from any Snip app that you are logged in to.

You can delete a Snip at any time from any app and it will be deleted from our database permanently. Be advised that this action is irreversible—we will not be able to recover this information for you. Please also note that image URLs can take up to 10 minutes to become invalid from the time a Snip is deleted.

What happens next is determined by whether you have allowed Mathpix to use your images to improve the Mathpix technology or not. If you have chosen to not allow us to use your images, your images stay in our database until your deletion. Your images and information cannot be accessed by any Mathpix employees except those responsible for server and database management. These employees undergo the required privacy training.

If you have chosen to allow Mathpix to use your images, an anonymized (all personally identifying information separated from the image) version of each of your images is sent to our Quality Assurance (QA) database.

Only our QA team, who are also required to undergo privacy training, can view these anonymous images.

### What happens when I use Search AI?

Mathpix Snip integrates with third party APIs ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) and [Anthropic](https://vault.pactsafe.io/s/9f502c93-cb5c-4571-b205-1e479da61794/legal.html#privacy)) for its generative answering capabilities. User queries and relevant documents are sent to these systems to generate appropriate answers. Mathpix Snip then presents these answers to the user within the app in the Intelligence section.

Third party service providers have a data retention policy of up to 30 days but don’t use your data for training. If you don’t want to have AI-generated answers when using Search AI, you can always turn it off on your Settings page. Doing so will ensure that no third party APIs will have access to your documents.

### How does Mathpix use my images to improve the image processing technology?

New and different images allow Mathpix to improve current recognition features and add new recognition features. If you allow Mathpix to use your images, anonymized versions of your images may be chosen for algorithm training purposes by our QA team. Regardless of if an image is selected by QA or not, all images in the QA database are permanently deleted after 60 days.

Whether you choose to let Mathpix use your images to improve our technology or not, we never retain any images in our QA databases that contain, or may contain, any personally identifiable information within the image.

---

### Who has access to my images?

If you have chosen to not allow Mathpix to use your images to improve our image processing technology, no one at Mathpix has the ability to view your images that are contained in our database. Only Mathpix employees responsible for maintaining our servers and databases have access credentials to our databases, where image information only exists in binary format.

If you have chosen to allow Mathpix to use your images to improve our image processing technology, only our QA team has access to completely anonymized images. Our QA team will never have access to your personal information, like your email or IP address.

We allow you to set your preferences about how our apps process the images you capture, and whether or not we can use your images to improve our technology, when you sign up for a Mathpix account. These preferences can be updated in your account settings at any time.

---

### Who has access to my personal information?

Access to your personal, account, and billing information is restricted to only to Mathpix employees or third party processors who require access to it in order to perform their function. We will never distribute your personal information except to provide products or services you have requested, when we have permission, or where it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding violations of our [Terms](https://mathpix.com/terms), or as otherwise required by law. We will never sell your personal information.

---

### What does Mathpix do to keep my personal information and my images safe?

We take our data management extremely seriously, and we have taken many measures to ensure that all data is managed in a way that protects your privacy. We only require the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your use of Mathpix services. We will never sell your information to third parties, and we only use it as described in this FAQ and our [Privacy Policy](https://mathpix.com/privacy).

Mathpix uses third party vendors and hosting partners for the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to provide our services. Although Mathpix owns the code, databases, and all rights to the Snip app, you retain all rights to your data.

In order to provide the best quality of service, we must monitor the images being processed by the app. All user data related to app usage is restricted and any image reviewed by our QA team has already been completely anonymized. Only those responsible for monitoring server health have access to user IP addresses. All images are deleted from our QA database after being reviewed by our QA team.

Please note that our policies and practices are subject to change; we are always trying to improve how we handle your data. Any changes to our policies will be reflected on our website in our [Privacy Policy](https://mathpix.com/privacy), [Terms and Conditions](https://mathpix.com/terms) or in this FAQ.

### How can I request access to all the information Mathpix has about me?

You have the right to request this information at any time, just send us an email at [support@mathpix.com](mailto:support@mathpix.com) and we will be happy to help you with your request.
