# Using Snip with Microsoft Excel (and any other spreadsheet software)

Snip can be used to extract tables/tabular data from PDFs and images.

When taking Snips of tables, the app will return a **TSV** format. **TSV** stands for Tab Separated Values, and when copied to your clipboard, it can be pasted directly into Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet software.

Here are the simple steps for using Snip to put tables in a spreadsheet:

1. Display the table want to insert into your spreadsheet on your screen.

2. Click the screenshot button or enter the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+m`/`ctrl+command+m`.
