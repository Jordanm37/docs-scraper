# Using Snip with Microsoft Word

There are two ways to use Snip to get math into your Microsoft Word document:

## Individual equations and blocks of math

When inserting individual equations into your MS Word document, it is easiest to copy the **MathML (MS Word)** format and paste it directly into your document.

1. Display the equation you want to insert into your document on your screen
2. Click the screenshot button or enter the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+m`/`ctrl+command+m`:

3. Click and drag the crop box around your desired equation, release to Snip:

4. Check your Snip result, then click the **Copy MS Word** button to copy the [MS Word optimized MathML](https://www.w3.org/Math/whatIsMathML.html) format to your clipboard:

*Pro Tip!* You can also copy the **MathML (MS Word)** format on the Data tab:

5. Open your Microsoft Word document and put your cursor at the location in the document where you would like to insert an equation, and paste!

## Larger content, mixed text & math

When taking Snips of mixed text and math, for example a multiple choice word problem, it is better to use the **Export to .docx** feature.

1. Display the content you want to digitize on your screen
2. Click the screenshot button or enter the keyboard shortcut
3. Click and drag the crop box around your desired content, release to Snip
4. Check your Snip result, then click the **Export .docx** button
