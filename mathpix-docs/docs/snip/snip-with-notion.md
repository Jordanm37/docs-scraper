# Using Snip with Notion

Equations can be inserted into [Notion](https://notion.so/) easily using LaTeX with Notion’s inline equation or LaTeX “blocks”.

It does not matter how you have your delimiter settings set up, because Notion requires raw LaTeX to render math in their documents.

## Block mode math in Notion

To insert a block mode equation into Notion, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure the equation you want to digitize is displayed on your screen. Click the screenshot button on the Snip app or enter the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+m`/`ctrl+command+m`. Click and drag the crop box around your desired equation, release to Snip.
2. Check your Snip result, then click the raw LaTeX format row (first row, no delimiters) to copy to your clipboard.

3. Click into your Notion document where you would like to insert your equation and then type `/` to show all of the Notion commands. You can type `/eq` to quickly pull up the commands you are looking for. Select **Block equation**.

4. Paste your raw LaTeX, then click **Done**.
