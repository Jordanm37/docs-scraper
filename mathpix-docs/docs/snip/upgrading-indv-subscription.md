# Upgrading to Mathpix Pro

For users who require more than 10 free Snips offered under the Free plan, we also offer a paid Pro subscription that gives you unlimited monthly Snips. Upgrading to Pro is simple, and can be done at any time [in your account settings](https://accounts.mathpix.com) by following these steps:

**1.** Log in to your account settings at [accounts.mathpix.com](https://accounts.mathpix.com).

**2.** The first page you will see is **Account**, this is where your personal account information can be found. Go to the second section, **Snip Subscription**. Here is where you can manage your subscription plan.

If you would like to pay with your PayPal account, switch to the PayPal tab. You should see a yellow button that says **PayPal checkout**

Next you’ll choose your PayPal payment method, and click **Continue**. To confirm the PayPal payment, click **Agree & Continue**.

You will then be redirected back to [accounts.mathpix.com](https://accounts.mathpix.com/), and you will see your PayPal account in the place where the yellow PayPal button had appeared before. To confirm your upgrade and charge your account, click **Pay $49.90 & subscribe**.

If you want to pay with Google Pay, switch to the Google Pay tab. Clicking this button will forward you to the Google Pay website, where you may be asked to add your payment card details.
