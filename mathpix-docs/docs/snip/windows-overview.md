## Quickstart guide

This is a brief guide for getting up and running Snip on your Windows computer. It will cover all the main features of the app and how they work.

**Install Snip**

If you haven’t already, download the Windows app from [our website](https://mathpix.com/desktop-downloads). If you run into any problems during the installation process, check out the [step-by-step installation guide](/docs/snip/windows-overview#installing-the-app).

**I’ve started the app, where is it?**

You will know that you have successfully started the app when you see this notification on your screen:

![Windows app started notification](/images/windows-setup2.webp)

If the app is running, you can find it in your system tray.

If you don’t see the Mathpix icon in your system tray, it might be hidden. Try clicking the **^** button to expand your system tray.

If the app window is open on your screen, you will also see the Mathpix icon in your dock.

**Logging in with your Mathpix Snip account**

Before you can start using the app, you must Log in with your Mathpix Snip account. Don’t have an account yet? You can sign up in the app or at [accounts.mathpix.com](https://accounts.mathpix.com). A full guide for creating your account can be found [here](creating-individual-account.md).

Click the Mathpix icon in your system tray to open the Log in screen. Enter the email and password (case sensitive) you signed up with to Log in. If the **Log In** button is disabled that means you haven’t entered a proper email or password — double check them! If you forgot your password and need to reset it, click **Forgot your password?** and a reset password link will be sent to your email.

Once you have entered your email address and password and successfully logged in, you will see your Snip List. If this is your first time using the app, the List will be empty and instead, you will see this message: *Click here to take a Snip! Or enter `CTRL+ALT+M` on your keyboard.*

![Empty list view](/images/empty-list-windows.webp)

**Taking a Snip**

There are two ways to take a Snip:

1. Click the Screenshot button in the top left corner of the app.

![Screenshot button](/images/screenshot-button-windows.webp)

2. Enter the keyboard shortcut (`CTRL+ALT+M`) anytime the app is running on your computer.

After either clicking the Screenshot button or entering the keyboard shortcut, your screen will turn gray and you will need to click and drag your cursor to capture the desired area of your screen.

Didn’t mean to take a Snip? You can exit the screenshot mode by clicking once.

**Syncing a Snip**

All Snips taken from your account will sync automatically with any device that you are logged into with the same account. Waiting for a Snip to sync? You can force an update by clicking the **Sync** button on the top right:

![Sync your Snips](/images/syncing-windows.webp)

**Using a Snip result**

Snip gives many different formats of results:

* LaTeX (best for LaTeX editors)
* Mixed text/LaTeX (best for Markdown editors)
* DOCX (best for MS Word)
* PNGs (best for WYSIWYG editors)
* Image URLs (best for HTML pages like blogs)

Text and LaTeX formats can be easily copied to your clipboard by toggling between the formats with your keyboard arrow keys. Whichever format row is selected will be copied to your clipboard automatically, so all you need to do is paste. (You can customize which text and LaTeX rows appear in the app or your desired LaTeX delimiters by going to **Settings** > **Formatting**.)

![Result view](/images/result-view-windows.webp)

You can copy or open a PNG format of either the original image or of the rendered LaTeX by clicking the buttons beneath the displayed image. Clicking **Copy PNG** automatically copies the image to your clipboard, while **Open PNG** will open the file in Preview.

Image URL formats can be found by navigating to the **Original** tab:

![URLs tab](/images/urls-tab-windows.webp)

There are three image URL formats:

* URL (best for sharing images in messaging & documentation tools)
* Markdown link (best for Markdown editors)
* HTML `<img>` tag (best for websites)

Just like the LaTeX and text format rows, whichever row is selected will be copied automatically to your clipboard.

**Editing a Snip**

Did your Snip result come back not quite right? You can edit the source to make it perfect!

First, click the **Edit** button (it looks like a pen) on your desired format row. (NOTE: if you edit the text mode (second) row, you will lose the math mode rows)

![Edit button](/images/edit-snip-windows.webp)

This will open the Snip editor. Make your changes in the text box, you will see the changes rendered instantly in the preview above. Once you have your desired result, click **Save**:

![Editing a Snip](/images/editing-snip-windows.webp)

Your Snip will update instantly and the updated result will be copied to your clipboard!

![Updated Snip](/images/updated-snip-windows.webp)

**Deleting a Snip**

You can delete an individual Snip from that Snip’s result page:

![Delete an individual Snip](/images/delete-snip-windows.webp)

You can delete all of your Snips from your Snip List page:

![Deleting all Snips](/images/delete-all-snips-windows.webp)

When you click the **Delete all Snips** button, you will be asked to confirm that you want to delete all of your Snips (since this is an irreversible action). Click the **Delete All Snips** button to confirm, or the **Cancel** button to cancel deletion.

![Confirm delete all](/images/delete-all-snips-confirm-windows.webp)

**Changing your settings**

To access the app Settings, click on the Settings wheel at the top right corner of the app.

Go to **Settings** > **General** to customize:

* all keyboard shortcuts
* if you want Snip to start at Log in
* notifications
* app window behavior

![General Settings](/images/general-windows.webp)

Go to **Settings** > **Formatting** to customize:

* which format rows display in your app
* your desired math mode LaTeX delimiters
* whether or not to include extra spaces in your LaTeX

![Formatting Settings](/images/formatting-windows.webp)

**Quitting Snip**

You can quit Snip at any time by right-clicking on the Mathpix icon in your system tray to open the menu and then choosing Quit.
