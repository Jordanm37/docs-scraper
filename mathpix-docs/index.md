> Mathpix claims to offer PDF -> LaTeX / Markdown conversion. I was skeptical… but the results are quite amazing! Does anyone know if this implements a published model? Or is it all proprietary?

> This is changing my life. Mathpix's "Snip" will let you screenshot an equation, and it will return the LaTeX code. Works passably on handwriting, and nearly flawlessly on pdf equations.

> An old idea, but I really like talking with PDFs instead of reading them. I use Mathpix to extract the text (does the best job of preserving tables), and GPT to discuss it.

> Mathpix Snip ([mathpix.com](https://t.co/6s87EI6FzM)) is a little marvel that converts a screen-grabbed equation into TeX code. Now it does something more: Searches the web for instances of the equation. (I've been waiting years for a math-enabled search engine.)
