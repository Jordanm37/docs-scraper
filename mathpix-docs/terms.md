## WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

THE MATHPIX SERVICES, THE SERVICES MATERIALS, AND ANY CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, MATHPIX DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON- INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. MATHPIX MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY THAT ANY OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR FREE; NOR DOES MATHPIX MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE LONGER OF THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF YOUR FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM DURATION ALLOWED BY LAW; BUT SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY BY JURISDICTION, AND WHICH ARE NOT MODIFIED BY THIS CLAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT DOING SO WOULD BREACH SUCH APPLICABLE LAW.

## Limitations of Liability

**Exclusion of Consequential Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL MATHPIX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, SERVICES MATERIALS OR CONTENT, OR FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION THROUGH ANY OF THE SERVICES OR FOR ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUE, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE AND ANY NON-ECONOMIC LOSSES, EVEN IF ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**Limitation of Damages**. THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF MATHPIX’S OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, AGENCY, WARRANTY, TRESPASS, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (US $100.00).

**Allocation of Risk and Material Term**. THESE PROVISIONS ON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT. THESE LIMITATIONS ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND MATHPIX AND ARE AN INTRINSIC PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF MATHPIX’S WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. THE FEES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT REFLECT THIS ALLOCATION OF RISKS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND SUCH LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING A FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

## General

Mathpix is based in the United States. Mathpix makes no claims that the content on the Services is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the Services Materials may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If You access any of the Services from outside the United States, You do so at Your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of Your jurisdiction.

**Force Majeure**. Neither party will be liable to the other for any breach of these Terms which arises because of any circumstances which the defaulting party cannot reasonably be expected to control (which shall include but not be limited to, any act of god (including pandemic), fire, casualty, flood, war, labor disputes, governmental action, failure of public services, interruption or failure of the Internet or of any network, telecommunications, power supply or infrastructure, or any provider of any of the foregoing) but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include shortage or lack of available funds, provided it promptly notifies the other party of such circumstances.

**Assignment**. You may not assign these Terms or any of Your rights or obligations hereunder by operation of law or otherwise, and any such attempt is void. Mathpix may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

**Electronic Communications**. Information communicated through the Site(s) as part of the Services constitutes an electronic communication. When You communicate with Mathpix through the Site(s) or other forms of electronic media, such as e-mail, You are communicating with Mathpix electronically. You agree that Mathpix, on behalf of itself and others who may be involved with delivering the Services, may communicate electronically by e-mail and/or may make communications available to You by posting them on the Site(s), and that such
communications, as well as notices, disclosures, agreements and other communications that We provide to You by such means are equivalent to communications in writing and shall have the same force and effect as if they were in writing and signed by Mathpix.

**Notices**. Notices and communications to Mathpix must be sent to support@mathpix.com.

Mathpix will send any notices to You at the e-mail You provided in Your Authorized User profile.

Notices sent by email shall be delivered to the email addresses designated by a party during the term of this Agreement and shall be deemed effective upon confirmation of delivery by a “read receipt” or other such notice of delivery generated by the applicable email system, but in any event, by reply of the recipient of such notice.

**Governing Law and Venue**. This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the substantive and procedural laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts between Massachusetts residents, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles that would require the application of the substantive or procedural laws of a different jurisdiction. In the event that any dispute between the parties arises out of or is related to any of the provisions of this Agreement, and/or the performance or termination thereof, the prevailing party in any such action will recover all of its costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. The parties agree that United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. Any claims for emergency or preliminary injunctive relief may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. All other disputes, claims or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or if there is federal jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and the parties agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts and the parties hereby waive all defenses based upon forum non conveniens, improper venue, or personal jurisdiction.

**Entire Agreement**. These Terms, together with the Mathpix Privacy Policy, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between You and Mathpix with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services or any part thereof. Any use of the term “including” in these Terms means “including without limitation”. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Mathpix’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. Mathpix and You are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.

**Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and the provision affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law.
